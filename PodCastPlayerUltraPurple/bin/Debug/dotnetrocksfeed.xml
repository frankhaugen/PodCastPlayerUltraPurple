					<title>Analyzing Source Code using Moose with Tudor Gîrba</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1172</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>You write a lot of code, but how often do you read it? And how do you read it? Carl and Richard talk to Tudor Girba about getting better at reading code by using tools that help you organize it. The conversation starts out with a simple idea - how do you get to understand the codebase of an existing application? Do you really just open a code window and start reading? Couldn't you use some tools that would help organize the code into some sort of summary that could get you moving faster? Tudor talks about Moose, a platform for doing software analysis. This leads to an idea called humane assessment, making it far easier to understand code - even your own!</description>

					<title>Less is More in Languages with Mark Seemann</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1170</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How much of a language is essential? Carl and Richard chat with Mark Seemann about what features are critical to a language, and which ones are redundant. Who would put redundant features in a language? Mark talks about how languages evolve, and how more advanced features can supercede older features, but the old features can never be removed without breaking existing code. And worst still, when building a language is your business, you'll add features whether they are needed or not - you need something new to sell! The conversation also digs into understanding languages more deeply - do you really need that if statement? Just because a feature exists doesn't mean you need to use it!</description>

					<title>Artificial Intelligence Geek Out</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1169</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So what is the state of Artificial Intelligence today? Carl and Richard geek out about what AI means today. The conversation starts out as usual with a bit of a history lesson - many things that were once called AI are now common, reliable technology like speech synthesis, natural language recognition, even vision systems. Once they work, they aren't AI any more. But the idea of an Artificial General Intelligence is much more challenging - and potentially risky. Richard digs through the key elements of AGI, the concept of the Singularity, comparing modern computers to the human brain and how close we may well be to making an AGI. But should we?</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Peer-to-Peer is more than BitTorrent! Carl and Richard talk to Matthew Podwysocki about the Thali Project, using peer-to-peer technology to put more power in the hands of the users. Matthew talks about being able to communicate between your various devices using WiFi and Bluetooth while maintaining privacy and not bouncing off a cloud server. The cornerstone is security, using TLS to encrypt all traffic in and out of your device. Messaging strategy, data synchronization and more are all part of the Thali Project, making this great technology all open source for anyone to use!</description>

					<title>Model Driven DevOps with Vishwas Lele</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1167</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>What's your DevOps plan? Carl and Richard talk to Vishwas Lele about taking a comprehensive, model-driven approach to DevOps. What does it mean to be model-driven? Working with a strategic approach that is agnostic to any given technology or platform - but in the end, the tools do matter! Vishwas talks about common elements like a single repository for all assets, repeatable deployment processes, instrumentation and feedback mechanisms that enable the entire team to see how the software is being used and improved. He also talks about the Azure templates for getting infrastructure up and running quickly - and the on-going evolution to let this model work anywhere, not just in the cloud!</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How do you debug browser problems in your web apps? Carl and Richard talk to Kenneth Auchenberg about RemoteDebug, an open source tool to bring a common debugging solution across browsers. And Ken really means across browsers - you can connect Chrome, Opera, FireFox, Safari and Internet Explorer up simultaneously and see how your code changes affect the rendering of your page on all those browsers at the same time! Oh, and it works for mobile browsers also, so you can experiment with rendering on multiple phones at once, and see how the pages really look while you make changes. You need to check this amazing tool out!</description>

					<description>What's missing from the DevOps story in the Windows world? While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard sat down with Jon Arild Tørresdal to talk about his struggles to have an effective DevOps practice in his organization using Windows technology. Jon talks about getting his teams to continuous deployment, rather than continuous delivery, so that there is a human interceding before software is deployed to the customer. Lots of conversation about instrumentation approaches, and getting to a place where code is deployed effectively for testing, but not visible to the customer. There's lots of challenges to a DevOps practice in the Windows world, but you can make it work!</description>

					<description>Isn't all functional programming lean? What does that even mean? While at NDC, Carl and Richard chatted with Bryan Hunter about lean principles and how they apply to functional programming. After a quick debate around the merits of object-oriented programming vs functional programming, the conversation turns to the history and principles of lean. Bryan shows how lean informs your approaches to programming, how you can evaluate your tooling and techniques to build the best software possible. Is functional programming the ultimate manifestation of lean?</description>

					<description>Why in the world would you want to build a compiler? While at NDC, Carl and Richard talked to Philip Laureano about why he makes compilers! Philip starts out talking how building compilers helps you think about parsers and how that can help your development in every day life. The conversation turns to building your own language, or your own interpretation of a language, such as LISP! Philip digs into understanding IL directly - using tools like ILDASM and PEVerify to manipulate the underlying code made by Visual Studio languages like C#.

					<pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How do you estimate your projects? While at NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Woody Zuill about delivering software WITHOUT estimates. Woody starts out with a clarification - it's not zero estimates, just no estimates around particular features for an application. But how? Your customers want estimates, the trick is to deliver so quickly that there isn't time to estimate before you've delivered code. And does it have to be code? Isn't our goal to solve problems, and code is only one possible solution? Lots of great thinking about how you provide value to your customers!</description>

					<title>Elixir and Phoenix with Chris McCord</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1159</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC, Carl and Richard talked to Chris McCord about Elixir - the friendly language on top of Erlang. Chris talks about his Phoenix framework which brings an MVC-style development approach to building web sites in Elixir. And because its the Erlang VM under the hood, it scales brilliantly! The efficiency of Erlang is remarkable as well, reducing the number of servers needed to provide a service, to the point where folks have been running a web site off of a Raspberry Pi 2! Phoenix is racing toward a version 1.0, and its a great time to get involved!</description>

					<description>While at NDC, Carl and Richard chat with Justin James about his deployment tool chain of NuGet, Chocolatey, Boxstarter and Vagrant. Each of these tools builds on the other, starting at the lowest level with specific libraries, working up through package managers, configuring operating systems, even provisioning cloud services. Justin talks about using the tools to get you to a configuration-as-code scenario, making installation not only reliable, but fast. There are lots of different ways to get to a reliable and efficient deployment solution - here's another one!</description>

					<title>Passwords, SQL Injection and WiFi Security with Troy Hunt</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1157</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard talk to Troy Hunt about all the scary stuff going on in security today. The conversation starts out recapping some discussion on passwords - how do we get past them? Troy also digs into the on-going issues of SQL Injection, still the number one security risk for web sites. You can still use Google to find vulnerable web sites, and there are great free tools out there to find and exploit insecure SQL databases - don't be one of them! The discussion turns to Strict Transport Security, making sure SSL is on all the time for a web site. Still gotta fix the basics, but new capabilities are coming!</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Where will .NET go next? Carl and Richard talk to Rocky Lhotka (who happily is still alive after having his entire aorta replaced) about the resurgence in .NET. Between the open sourcing of .NET creating a common codebase for Windows, OSX and Linux. But that codebase is server focused - what does it take to get to the client? And to that idea, should XAML be open sourced? Rocky drills into the challenges of making cross-platform mobile apps - it's still not simple enough yet. But things are looking up, and there is only going to be more choice. Rocky is optimistic!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>If it's on the cloud, it'll scale and perform, right? Carl and Richard talk to Christopher Bennage about his work at Patterns and Practices helping understand where performance can go wrong with Azure. It's on GitHub to provide code samples and analysis on the various problems you can find with scaling your Azure app. Christopher discusses eight different anti-patterns the PnP folks have found in their travels that can impair performance. Included in each are code samples and analysis of performance on Azure to show improvements - and you can run the code yourself on Azure to compare! </description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Time for an Energy Storage Geek Out! The most requested Geek Out on FeatHub as Battery Technology, Carl and Richard discuss a wide range of aspects of energy storage. The conversation starts out on electrochemical batteries, which are only about 200 years old. Richard digs through the technical aspects of anode, cathode and electrolyte, dry cells, wet cells and polymer cells. And why do some batteries explode, anyway? Then the focus is on Tesla's new PowerWall battery products, what they're good for and what they aren't. And before the end, some other storage techniques like superconductors, ultracapacitors and flywheels! </description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So how are you instrumenting your applications? Carl and Richard talk to Jason Taylor of Stackify and Michael Paterson of Carbonite about the power of great instrumentation to make awesome software. Stackify provides a set of free tools if you're working in Azure. And speaking of Azure, Carbonite lives on Azure and uses Stackify for instrumentation. Michael talks about how Stackify helped Carbonite understand performance problems and errors that were occurring in production that were very hard to see from logs or customer service requests - deeply instrumenting their application made all the difference!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How do you extend C#? Carl and Richard talk to Simon Cropp about his open source project called Fody. Simon talks how Fody allows you do do "weaving" of .NET assemblies to add capabilities. Sounds simple, but it's not - it's hugely powerful and has to be handled carefully. To make it even more amazing, there are a ton of add-ins built for Fody to open the door to all sorts of aspect-oriented programming, simplifying testing, instrumentation and other sorts of coding extensions. So many possibilities, you should check it out!</description>

					<description>So how deep are you into Domain Driven Design? Carl and Richard talk to David Rael about his work applying DDD principles to the systems his customers develop. David focuses in on the idea of the ubiquitous language, something Eric Evans admits he wishes he'd put earlier in his seminal book on DDD. The ubiquitous language is the assembly of all the terms needed and agreed upon about the particular domain that the application has being built for. Most of what you need to know to build an application lives in that language, and most of what can go wrong goes wrong there. Great, focused conversation from someone living the DDD life!</description>

					<description>Microservices? Carl and Richard talk to Howard Dierking about his work building microservices starting with the name - Howard hates the term microservices. He prefers to call them focused services, which only makes sense. The goal is to write as little code as possible while delivering the capabilities needed, not all that different from most modern development approaches. The conversation turns to how we've twisted service design because deployment and versioning were so difficult. Today its better and we can take advantage of granularity to keep our services small, independently updated and flexible! </description>

					<description>Have you been building web apps with TypeScript? Carl and Richard talk to Steve Ognibene about his work with TypeScript projects. The discussion starts with dispelling myths about TypeScript - no, it doesn't exist just to make C# developers more comfortable in web development! Steve compares how development is different in the strongly typed world of C# where the compiler does a bunch of testing for you versus the dynamically typed space of JavaScript where you're responsible for managing type related errors - something that TypeScript can help with! In the end its all JavaScript, and that is evolving also - Steve talks about how ECMA 6 looks a lot more like C#... is there a middle point here we're all racing toward?</description>

In an effort to bring back the calendar, Steve and Brendan have launched a kickstarter campaign to raise enough funds to make the calendar, and a feathub site to take suggestions for the various pictures and ideas of each month.

					<description>So how are you using Azure for your apps? Carl and Richard talk to Mark Brown about his work inside and outside of Microsoft - after fifteen years at Microsoft, Mark is out on his own now and still working hard with Azure. The conversation digs into the amazing tool that is Web Jobs, letting you automate tasks based on time and events. Mark also talks about machine learning as his new focus, recognizing that the huge amount of data we're gathering needs to be analyzed too. Lots of great thinking about the cloud!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So what has happened with the .NET Core? Carl and Richard talk to Jay Schmelzer about his involvement from the very beginning of the .NET Core infrastructure and the interesting future it has as an open source project. But first a call back to a project that Jay led for years - LightSwitch. So where has it gone and where is it going? Then the conversation turns to the .NET Core. Jay talks about how the development team at Microsoft is starting to do their development in public on the open source project that is now the .NET Core. And then there's OS/X and Linux! How do you separate off capabilities of .NET that are actually part of the operating system, rather than the .NET codebase? Lots of complexity to support cross platform like this, but it opens the door to .NET being everywhere!</description>

Alas, the conversation is not about making computers out of biological materials, but there is some discussion about using DNA to do some kinds of computing as well as building synthetic life from modified cells. Colin talks about the tools they're building to be able to simulate cell generations and understand how stem cells evolve into specialized cells. A cool technology/biology Geek Out!</description>

					<description>What does it take to grow new developers into something more experienced? Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Casimir about his approach to shepherding developers, helping them to grow into experienced developers. But what sort of experiences should you have? The conversation digs into the ideas around intentional practice, something rarely done in software. Jeff also talks about the scarcity of mentors and what it takes to get your code reviewed on a regular basis with an expert - and what an expert review even looks like! It's a challenge we need to rise to: there are more new developers all the time!</description>

					<description>So where does BizTalk fit into your Azure application? Carl and Richard talk to Sam Vanhoutte about his work using BizTalk technology to integrate systems together with Azure in the middle. The conversation pokes a little fun at BizTalks's on-going battle for relevance - for the customers that really need it, it is awesome. But now it's available as a cloud product in Azure which can save a ton in hardware fees, enough to run the infrastructure for a long time. Sam also digs into Enterprise Service Buses and their role in the modern infrastructure. Good stuff!</description>

					<description>How does your organization leverage open source? Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Strauss about open source coming into the corporate space and the challenges that exist there. Microsoft has gone into open source in a big way, how does that affect our development going forward? The conversation starts out talking about Microsoft's approach to open source, especially around the open source promise. From there Jeff dives into the range of open source licenses out there, from the various copyleft concepts in the GPL to the more permissive licenses of MIT and BSD. There's also the whole area of Contributor Licensing as well. You may not love the legal side of software, but that doesn't mean you can ignore it!</description>

					<description>We're back from Build! On the last day of Build, Carl and Richard went up to the TWiT.tv studios to record a Windows Weekly with Leo LaPorte, Paul Thurrott and Mary Jo Foley. That show went more than two hours, so we thought we'd make a more condensed version and focus on our favorite bits of Build. And feeing Leo lots of Scotch, you wouldn't want to miss that. The conversation starts out with a bit more of an IT bent, talking about data lakes and docker virtualization. From there Carl digs into the Universal Apps bridges, allowing developers to build iOS and Android apps in Visual Studio with native languages, but across platforms. Check out the link for signing up to the previews of all the Universal App Bridges. What an amazing Build!</description>

How do you create change in that scenario? How many times do you have to repeat a new approach to things before it actually sticks?

					<description>So what is the state of open source in the .NET community? While at the .NET Fringe conference, Carl and Richard moderated a panel of Ian Cooper, Amy Palamountain, Scott Hanselman, Sebastian Lambla and James Nugent as they explore the past, present and future of open source and the .NET stack. Obviously having Microsoft open source huge tracts of the .NET stack is a huge topic on its own, but so is the role the Microsoft should play in the open source community. What makes this community different from other open source communities? Are things moving in the right direction, is it getting better? Listen for some significant debate and thinking from a broad spectrum of open source folks!</description>

					<title>Moore's Law Geek Out</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1130</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So when will Moore's Law end? Time for a Geek Out! In honor of the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore writing the article that 10 years later would be known as Moore's Law, Richard digs into how much work goes into keeping the Moore's Law promise and its impact on society. The conversation delves into the complexities of manufacturing microchips at the nanometer scale, and all of the problems that companies like Intel and Samsung have to overcome for each incremental improvement that leads to a doubling of density every 18-24 months. The laws of physics dictate that Moore's Law will eventually end, but there are still a few years to go... and even when it does end, so what? Is Moore's Law holding back innovations in other areas? Lots to think about!</description>

					<title>The Evolution of JavaScript Libraries with Scott Allen</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1129</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So what JavaScript libraries are you focused on today? Scott Allen is back to talk about the latest bits he's excited about, including Rob Eisenberg's Aurelia! The conversation starts out focused on the on-going evolution of Javascript, with ECMA 6 and 7 picking up more and more features of modern programming languages - it's not the JavaScript you remember from the old days! This also impacts JavaScript libraries and opens the door for the on-going evolution of those libraries. Some change radically like AngularJS and some stick with their patterns so that new tools can get built, like Aurelia. While it's still early days for Aurelia, Scott is so keen that he's dived in as a contributor to the open source product. You should check it out!</description>

					<title>Docker for Developers with Seth Lachner</title>

					<pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So how does Docker change development? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard chatted with Seth Lachner about his work with Docker and the impact it has had on him as a developer. Seth comes from the old school open source world of Linux and C, and has worked with Docker for a long time - he recognized the potential early on. The conversation digs into the concepts of Docker as a virtualization entity on top of an operating system, hooking tightly into the kernel of the operating system to provide isolation for applications without the heavy footprint of traditional VMs. The conversation ranges over the cloud, server and workstation uses of containers, even into the idea of Docker as a virtual application implementation. This tool has far reaching consequences, no wonder there is so much buzz around it!</description>

					<description>How do you deal with failure? Carl and Richard talk to Dustin Thostenson about his experiences with failure and how they made him a better developer. The conversation starts out with a discussion of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and how that ultimately maps to our needs as developers as well. The needs build on each other, and you can have a higher-level need without a lower-level need being fulfilled. Dustin talks about how this hierarchy informs his understanding of a prospective employee during the interview. The questions you ask say a lot about who you are!</description>

					<description>What does it mean to be a modern mobile developer? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard talked to Heather Downing about her recent dive into mobile development. In only a few years, Heather has been involved in a number of cool projects and talks about learning on the fly to build native, hybrid, and web-based mobile applications. The conversation explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the stacks, and the enthusiasm that comes from being effective and successful even without decades of experience. As Heather says, when a new framework comes out, everyone is a novice, no matter how much experience you have. There is no substitute for working hard to learn and understand what the framework brings to the table.</description>

					<description>How did you learn to debug? While at the Nebraska Code Camp, Carl and Richard talked to Joel Kauffman about debugging practices. Rarely is debugging taught in classes, arguably because all school code is perfect. But code in the real world has bugs, and finding those bugs can be challenging. Joel talks about helping developers understand how debugging works, utilizing stack traces, working backward through code, using watches, and so on. The conversation also digs into various tools available for assisting in debugging production applications, including open source JavaScript libraries and much more expensive dedicated instrumentation products. But good debugging is worth a lot - it's a worthy skill to cultivate!</description>

The panel also discussed various JavaScript libraries, when they should be used and when plain old VanillaJS is a better way to go. Conversation also explored design tooling and whether we all should be running Visual Studio or stick with dedicated design tools and editors. Lots of viewpoints from a great panel!</description>

					<description>How do you do agile faster? Carl and Richard talk to Dan North about accelerating agile - but Dan has changed the name to Software, Faster. And even that is controversial, as Dan talks about focusing on delivering business needs, which may or may not involve code. The conversation also calls back to the Agile Manifesto and its abuse - it's not code with no documentation, its code over documentation! There's a great digression about the BBC giving away a million tiny computers to children to help create a new generation of makers... it's a fun time to be in computing! And as Dan says, the only code that has no bugs at all is no code at all.</description>

					<description>Where can iBeacons take you? Carl and Richard talk to Greg Shackles about some of the opportunities available using beacon devices with smartphones. While iBeacons are specifically an Apple technology, there are lots of third party implementations that are more open. The balancing act of power and capability is a constant struggle for beacons. Things get really fun when you start looking at all the ways you can locate someone in an interior space using beacons - opening the door to a huge number of applications. Beacons are also part of Google's Physical Web, creating the idea of "interaction on demand." Cool stuff!</description>

Things get really fun when you start looking at all the ways you can locate someone in an interior space using beacons - opening the door to a huge number of applications. Beacons are also part of Google's Physical Web, creating the idea of "interaction on demand." Cool stuff!</itunes:summary>

					<description>Are you building in WPF? Are you using PRISM? Carl and Richard talk to Brian Noyes and Brian Lagunas about the PRISM project, which is a set of tools for building WPF apps. As Brian Noyes says, PRISM is the AngularJS of WPF! The conversation dives into the on-going evolution of PRISM, including support for Windows Phone and Universal Apps. The point of PRISM is composability, helping you to organize the elements of your application into something more maintainable, easier to test and continue to evolve. Brian and Brian also announce that they are running the PRISM project now and have moved it to GitHub - they will take your pull requests!</description>

					<description>Programming in Swift? Want to build Android apps too? Carl and Richard talk to Marc Hoffman of RemObjects about his Silver project - using Swift to program for Android. Swift is Apple's cool new language for developing iOS apps, making life easier than Objective C. Don't use Swift? No problem, how about Pascal - because RemObjects has Oxygene, which is a moderized version of Pascal. That doesn't work for you? Then how about C#? Because this tool set lets you write C# across all the platforms too. And you can use it in the development environment of your choice, including Visual Studio. Mind blown? Ours too!</description>

					<description>So when do IT Pros become developers? Carl and Richard talk to Steve Evans about his operations folks writing code and dealing with all the challenges that everyone finds when they write, own and operate code. The code in question is primarily PowerShell, used to automate deployment. It needs testing, source control and everything else that code requires. Steve talks about how his operations folks have come to learn the same things that all developers need to learn, and for the most part, end up using the same tools. PowerShell may have its own IDE, but more than ever the IT Pros want to use Visual Studio for its richness of tools and integration with resources that they realize they need. Now all we have to do is convince Microsoft that just because you operate systems doesn't mean you don't program!</description>

					<description>How are you dealing with mobile testing? Karen Johnson talks to Carl and Richard about thinking through the big picture when it comes to testing. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the tools we've had for desktop and web testing for years that are still hard to come by on the mobile platform - like UI capture of touch, gestures and typing. Its just not that easy to do capture on a phone. The diversity of products is a huge part of the problem, but its also the rapidly evolving operating systems and technology. Karen also digs into other devices like wearables and other physical instrumentation devices. The scope of the testing problem is only getting bigger!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How do you test your cross platform applications? Carl and Richard talk to Paul Mooney about building software in .NET and Java and wanting to use a common set of testing protocols. Tricky, but possible! The conversation focuses in on abstractions, which are key to creating sufficient separation of functionality to allow you to insert testing code regardless of what language you work in. And it turns out you can write tests for multiple languages if you're careful. Java and .NET are more similar than we care to admit, and it opens the door to other approaches to testing. TDD is not platform specific!</description>

The conversation focuses in on abstractions, which are key to creating sufficient separation of functionality to allow you to insert testing code regardless of what language you work in. And it turns out you can write tests for multiple languages if you're careful. Java and .NET are more similar than we care to admit, and it opens the door to other approaches to testing. TDD is not platform specific!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Ionic Framework with Troy Miles</title>

					<pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>So how do you build your cross-platform mobile apps? Carl and Richard talk to Troy Miles about his experiences building mobile apps with the Ionic Framework. Built over top of Adobe Cordova, Ionic takes over a lot of the plumbing code that you find yourself building in every mobile app. Ionic brings controls to the table in two forms - pure CSS components and CSS/JavaScript. You could write the CSS yourself (or maybe you couldn't), but why would you? Troy talks about some of the applications out in the marketplace built with Ionic and how well they look and act like native apps, without having to write the app from scratch multiple times. Check it out!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Jez Humble is back and building a lean enterprise! Carl and Richard talk to Jez about continuous delivery and all that amazing DevOps stuff - but then we get to the serious bit, which is really about how DevOps is a manifestation of organizational change. You need buy-in from the top to make it happen, but it can't happen all at once. How do you make gradual improvements to present the power of a better culture with deeper understanding? Jez talks about the importance of metrics and measuring the performance of your software. And in the end, the best metrics are the ones that relate to the business - which is a great way to talk to management!</description>

					<description>Well, there goes another milestone - show 1100! Since Richard actually joined as co-host starting with show 100, that makes ONE THOUSAND .NET Rocks episodes together. Sure, there's 130 Tablet Shows, but who's counting? The conversation digs into a bunch of the gear used to make .NET Rocks and all the PWOP podcasts. We may not take ourselves too seriously, but we sure do take podcasting seriously. You wanna know how it's done? Have a listen!</description>

					<description>Are you ready for ECMAScript 6? Carl and Richard talk to Jafar Husain about some of the great new features coming in ECMAScript 6 - the next version of JavaScript, at least for now. Jafar talks about the fun and challenges of participating in the TC39 committee that developed the ES6 standard which is now being implemented by browser developers. Jafar digs into Promises, Yields, Proxies and more - lots of discussion about features you've come to love in languages like C# appearing in JavaScript! And the process isn't done, the JavaScript 7 spec is already being developed!</description>

					<description>Are you ready for C# 6? Carl and Richard talk to Bill Wagner about the latest changes to C# 6, with some features being dropped (perhaps to appear in a later version), some syntax changes, and digging deeper on some of the more complex features available. Now that everything around C# is open source, you can see the process of developing new features going on, and even participate in it! Bill and Richard also talk about Humanitarian Toolbox, their ongoing effort to build open source software for disaster relief organizations. And even a little discussion about C# 7!</description>

					<description>So what comes after Durandal? Rob Eisenberg talks to Carl and Richard about Aurelia! The conversation starts out focused on AngularJS and Rob's role with the open source project and ultimate departure. But that was back in November 2014 - what happens next? Aurelia is Rob's vision of what web developers need to build effective browser-based client applications. Rob talks about implementing Aurelia to utilize ECMAScript 6 and 7 while still polyfilling back to ES5 - the Javascript you recognize. This leads to a whole discussion on transpiling and how its possible to move a language forward without breaking backward compatibility, even a language as diverse as Javascript!</description>

					<description>Are you ready to build web pages with web components? Cory House is! Carl and Richard talk to Cory House about the web component specification and what that will look like in your modern web development. As Cory explains, the key idea behind web components is to provide a framework for Javascript library extensibility that doesn't force you to own the library yourself. While the standard is still being discussed, Cory mentions some libraries that have already gone ahead and implemented a variation of this extensibility, such as Steve Sanderson's amazing KnockoutJS. Web components make Javascript that much better to use!</description>

					<description>Looking at moving from WinForms to WPF? Phil Japikse can help! Carl and Richard talk to Phil Japikse about the changes in thinking that have to happen to make WPF work for you if you're coming from a WinForms world. The conversation starts out discussing the strengths of WinForms and why they persist to this day - it just works! And there's no designer experience like it, including WPF. No matter where you go, after WinForms, you're going to spend more time looking at code for your UI. Do you have to learn MVVM? It depends! Phil talks about the different approaches to making WPF work for you, and taking your UI to it's full potential.</description>

Carl and Richard talk to Bob Martin about the growth of developers, and how the number of new developers is overwhelming the available teaching and mentoring resources available today. The discussion turns to the fact that customers would rather have mentors writing code than teaching new developers - better to throw the new folks in a room and let them fend for themselves, maybe software will come out! Uncle Bob talks about the rise of professionalism, the need for professional associations or guilds, taking on the liability of software - the challenge is getting there.</description>

					<description>Duck punch your JavaScript lately? Todd Gardner talks to Carl and Richard about the practice of changing object behaviors in JavaScript for good or evil. After an explanation of how duck punching (or monkey patching, pick your favorite silly term) works, the discussion turns to the dark side of how hackers can intercept your Javascript library calls, capture keystrokes and otherwise subtly change your web pages. Could you tell? Then Todd dives into using your powers for good - strategies for testing, aspect-oriented programming and so on. Duck punching does have significant limitations, so use sparingly, but when it works, its amazing! (NOTE: no ducks were harmed in the making of this podcast)</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Dominick Baier and Brock Allen about the new version of Thinktecture IdentityServer. As Dominick explains, as soon as you have more than one web application that needs authentication, you want to go to a centralized authentication and authorization scheme, and that's where IdentityServer comes into play. Working with oAuth2 and OpenID Connect, you can create identities for your users from Active Directory, other IMAP stores or just a plain old SQL Server. Take your authentication strategy to the next level!</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Ready to think beyond the SPA? John Papa talks about the continuing evolution of HTML 5. Carl and Richard chat with John about web components, an evolving standard to make JavaScript libraries more extensible and organized. AngularJS comes out in the conversation as well, especially version 2 with its breaking changes - but you don't need to migrate if you don't want to. V1 will continue development. John also digs into his current suite of tools for building, deploying, and debugging web pages. The technology is maturing, and that means better tools!</description>

					<description>Can computing cure cancer? That's Evelina Gabasova's goal! Carl and Richard talk to Evelina about her work using machine learning and data analytics to understand the genetics of cancer, its variations and subtypes. Part of her goal is to get to personalized medicine - where your doctor uses your genetic information to determine the ideal treatment, custom-made for you. So how does that involve statistics?

					<pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>How many different ways can you store data? David Simons knows at least ten! Carl and Richard talk to David about a wide variety of data storage approaches. Some are SQL, some are NoSQL, but David digs into each one talking about strengths and weaknesses. The conversation digs into the idea that using one data store for all purposes is archaic - while it always depends on your application's needs, have two, three, or four different data stores isn't crazy! David talks about various classes of data stores including graph, object, time series, relational, and more... there are lots of ways to store your data, and with the right store, coding and maintaining get easier! The trick is to deal with the essentials of every data store: reliability, backup, and recovery. Here's a great list of choices for your app!</description>

					<description>What does Sharepoint Development look like today? Carl and Richard talk to Sahil Malik about the amazing changes that have happened to the Sharepoint development community with the impact of Azure and Office 365. Sharepoint used to be a very insular development environment, separate from everything else, but today it is expected to interact with cloud services, on-premise system and a variety of clients, including iPhone, Android, WinPhone and more. Sahil talks about gluing all the pieces together - you can't build it all yourself!</description>

					<title>The Google Cloud with Brad Abrams</title>

					<pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Do you know about Google Cloud? Brad Abrams does! Carl and Richard talk to former Microsoftie Brad Abrams about the other big cloud player - and there's a lot to say. Brad starts out focusing on the Platform-as-a-Service offerings of Google such as the App Engine which lets you run Python, Java, PHP, and Go in the cloud with all the scaling options you could ever want. Rather a virtual machine? The Google Compute Engine handles that, with Windows as an option coming soon! Then the discussion turns to containers: lightweight, OS-agnostic virtual machines that work with Google Container Engine and scale with Kubernetes. And that's still only the beginning; there's storage options of all sorts and Brad's favorite bits, great tracing and debugging tools. There's room for a third player in the public cloud world!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard moderated a panel of Ben Hall, Peter Mounce, Jeff French and Enrico Campidoglio to talk about the state of DevOps in the .NET world. While DevOps is going strong in the open source world, it is coming slowly to .NET. The panelists discuss their preferred toolchains for speeding deployment, testing and instrumentation of software, as well as the cultural changes that have happened in their organizations as an effect or demand of DevOps. The conversation also turns to looking at the tools Microsoft is building to support DevOps vs. the open source tools that are adding Windows and .NET support. There's still a long ways to go!</description>

					<title>Programming in Elixir with Bryan Hunter</title>

					<pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talked with Bryan Hunter about the language Elixir. Bryan tells the story of how the folks behind Ruby got interested in Erlang, thinking to bring some of Erlang's features to other languages - but then discovered it was impossible, since Erlang is its own operating system. So instead, they created a new language within Erlang, and that is Elixir. Taking the favorite features of many languages including Ruby, C#, F# and others, Elixir makes for a pleasant programming experience while still having the power of Erlang behind you. Check it out!</description>

					<description>While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Enrico Campidoglio about including databases in your continuous delivery process. Enrico talks through a few different strategies for getting your database moving as fast as your application, without losing data along the way. The conversation digs into issues around version control for databases, keeping schema and reference tables in your source control system, and recognizing that database updates don't happen at the same time as application updates - there can be updates before and after, or otherwise independent of the application itself. Lots of little tips and tricks for managing your database updates more effectively!</description>

					<description>While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard sat down with Mark Rendle to talk about the latest version of Simple.Data - version 2! Simple.Data started out years ago as a simple abstraction for data access, all open source with numerous additional projects built on it to support a huge variety of data stores. Mark talks about going back into his old V1 project and realizing he did some interesting twists and turns to make it work, and how a rethink of the design brought out the idea of V2. The conversation also digs into the fundraising efforts he did to incentivize getting an alpha version of V2 together. Lots of fun digressions on various projects and ideas as well!</description>

					<description>Another great show from NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Ben Hall about Docker. Docker has been taking the industry by storm, bringing a lighter-weight approach to virtualization by getting the operating system out of the package and focusing on automated configuration and implementation. Ben talks about the origins of Docker and its focus on the Linux world - but that is rapidly changing with Microsoft promising an implementation running on Windows. The potential of Docker for facilitating efficient development is obvious, but could this change how we use applications as a whole?</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard got the amazing opportunity to go to the NASA Goddard Space Flight center to see the James Web Space Telescope in person. And while there, they sat down with Craig Tooley, the Project Manager of the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) to understand a bit more about space weather and the remarkable science and engineering that goes into a mission like MMS. The MMS mission utilizes four identical spacecraft flying in formation to measure plasma interaction effects between the Earth's magnetosphere and the sun. The goal of MMS to capture (by flying through) a magnetic reconnection event, where a huge amount of plasma energy is discharged. As with most things in the universe, reality is a complex thing, and the MMS is at the forefront of our understanding of the universe, at least around our planet!</description>

					<description>At the NDC London conference, Carl and Richard talk to Steve Sanderson about his work on the Azure Portal and building arguably the greatest Single Page Application (SPA) around today. Steve talks about the approach the Azure Portal team has taken to deal with memory management as well as a flexible plugin architecture that allows the various Azure related teams to plug into the common "shell" component of the Azure Portal. The conversation digs into the challenges of SPAs as the scale and utilization goes up. You can make it work, but it isn't always simple! Steve also discusses the choices you can make around SPAs, it's not just about AngularJS, there are many ways to build a SPA toolchain.</description>

					<title>Writing Compilers with Phil Trelford</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1074</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC London at the Excel Center, Carl and Richard talked to Phil Trelford about building your own compiler. First off, why would you do that? Phil talks about the various ways that compiler technology can be used and help improve your own understand of languages and tools. You probably don't need to replace the C# compiler for your applications, but you might want to use parsing technology to provide algorithmic support in your applications. The power of F# is apparent when you start working on compilers, with its amazing pattern matching and parsing capabilities. Phil also mentions some toolsets to make experimenting with compilers easier, check out the show links for more info!</description>

					<title>Starting a Software Business with Liam Westley</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1073</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the NDC London conference, Carl and Richard talk to Liam Westley about building your own software business. It starts with the idea that the most destructive thing to your software business is support calls - or more broadly, the accumulated cost of your past business. The conversation digs into the power of being a business of one, rather than having employees, and thinking beyond just your development work, digging into all the other aspects of business: marketing, sales, accounting, and so on. As Liam says, starting a software business is easy, staying in business is hard!</description>

					<title>Chrome Developer Tools with Shay Friedman</title>

					<pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC in London, Carl and Richard talk to Shay Friedman about the Chrome Developer Tools. The conversation starts out talking a bit about the state of web development, the jump in JavaScript performance, and the huge increase in the complexity of web applications - which naturally leads to the challenge of debugging said JavaScript-based applications. Enter the Chrome Developer Tools. Firefox was the original web developer browser, but Chrome has slid into that slot with more capabilities than ever. More than just element inspection, the Chrome Developer Tools let you look at your web application executing on the browser. Shay talks about tracking down memory leaks in complex Javascript code, where many variables are created, but few are destroyed. You need these tools in your kit!</description>

					<title>Hexagonal Architectures in .NET with Ian Cooper</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1071</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC London, Carl and Richard talk to Ian Cooper about hexagonal architectures. Turns out the important part is not the six sides - it's the idea of ports and adapters. Originally talked about by Alistair Cockburn, this is an architectural approach that focuses on being tolerant to testing as well as separating commands from querying. It's not quite Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), but you can see it from there! Ian discusses testing in a hexagonal architecture and how Test Driven Development (TDD) works so well with the separation of concerns that ports and adapters offers. If you're working on a long lived application that needs to be maintainable, you should be looking at hexagonal architecture!</description>

					<title>Entity Framework 7 with Julie Lerman</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1070</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Julie is back and all about the latest version of Entity Framework - version 7! The conversation starts out with a bit of a state of the union, with Julie describing how moving Entity Framework to GitHub has opened up an amazing level of communication between the EF team and regular developers. Which leads to the scarier part of the discussion: The breaking changes coming to EF7 from EF6. Like ASP.NET vNext, EF7 represents a substantial break. But Julie says you shouldn't worry, there are lots of solutions. Oh, and did she mention that they are planning on including support for non-relational (NoSQL) data stores? Really!</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to David Božjak about the Lumia Imaging SDK... or is it the Nokia Imaging SDK? Caught in the midst of a name change since the acquisition of Nokia phones, the SDK is called Lumia Imaging on the blog sites, but is still Nokia Imaging on NuGet. Certainly it'll all be Lumia some day. David talks about the huge array of features available in the SDK to take photos, apply filters and effects to them, and then render the images. The conversation digs into how to handle huge images when you have limited memory, so that thumbnails and partial renders keep the memory footprint down, and streamed rendering lets something phone size still render the full image. Cool stuff for your mobile app!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Rocky Lhotka about where universal apps in Visual Studio are really going. But first, a bit of a landscape discussion, especially a laugh about the "comeback" of .NET and C#. Did Xamarin save the day? Rocky talks about how universal apps aren't all that universal, but with Xamarin in the mix, you start to look at a common code base for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile development. Almost. Maybe. It's always more complicated than you think! But Rocky is optimistic that things are going the right way, so that everyone can start building cross-platform applications for their customers really soon.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Itamar Syn-Hershko about adding search technologies to your application. The conversation starts out focused on what SQL Server can do for search... the LIKE operator. What about NoSQL? Itamar talks about the role that data stores like RavenDB can play as far as finding data. But then you get to dedicated indexing and search tools like Lucerne.NET, ElasticSearch and Solr. Itamar talks about the advantages of using these tools in terms of speed of indexing and search, as well as the ability to bring multiple data sources together under a common indexing strategy. How do you do search in your app?</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1064</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk about two space accidents that happened in the same week - the explosion of Orbital Science's Antares Rocket on October 28 and the breakup of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo on October 31. Richard begins with the Orbital Science's mission to supply the International Space Station. Part of NASA's Commercial Resupply Services, the ORB-3 mission included the Cygnus spacecraft carrying supplies to the ISS as well as a number of smaller payloads, including the Arkyd-3. The Antares rocket exploded a few seconds after launch. The discussion digs into the origins of the rocket design and Orbital's subsequent actions to deal with the loss of the rocket - they're still responsible to get those supplies to the station! The second part of the show is even more serious, since it involves a fatality - the breakup of SpaceShipTwo during a test flight, resulting in the death of co-pilot Michael Alsbury. Is making space commercially viable worthwhile even at the expense of someone's life?</description>

Simon digs into more traditional advertising using the open source Adrotator library, which takes the discussion into the complexity of advertising - multiple providers, different systems for different locations, and how often you don't actually *get* an ad! </description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Scott Ford about taking over existing software projects. There's lots of negativity around existing code, calling them "brownfield" and "legacy projects." Scott looks at existing projects more like an older home that has been well used, but needs updating. The conversation digs into how to understand not only the code of the existing application, but also the intent of the app - more focus on why things are the way they are, rather than just the how parts. But once you understand the why, there's no reason to stick with old tools and techniques, and Scott talks about using modern tools to quickly take control of an existing codebase and make it more reliable, understandable and sustainable.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to David Dennison about his complete change of development career: From C# and .NET to Scala and the JVM! David talks about getting work at iTrellis, and their move to a services stack of Scala, Akka and Spray. The discussion focuses on the many things that are the same between the platforms, as well as the differences - it's all managed code in the end! David also talks about getting into the mindspace of the new platform he is working in, as well as dealing with entirely new development tools and infrastructure. Could you change platforms if the opportunity arose?</description>

					<itunes:summary>Carl and Richard talk to David Dennison about his complete change of development career: From C# and .NET to Scala and the JVM! David talks about getting work at iTrellis, and their move to a services stack of Scala, Akka and Spray. The discussion focuses on the many things that are the same between the platforms, as well as the differences - it's all managed code in the end! David also talks about getting into the mindspace of the new platform he is working in, as well as dealing with entirely new development tools and infrastructure. Could you change platforms if the opportunity arose?</itunes:summary>

					<title>Continuous Integration of Mobile Apps with Greg Shackles</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1060</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Greg Shackles about making continuous deployment work in the mobile apps space. The conversation starts out with the projects that Greg is currently working on, and the need to get them deployed routinely to iOS and Android devices - this means, of course, deployment to the AppStore, which only goes so fast. Greg talks about avoiding the AppStores by finding ways to make changes internally, rather than a full deploy. The discussion goes down his preferred toolchain and inserting as much automation as possible - not so much for speed as for repeatability! Check out Greg's talks and slides in the show notes on this subject.</description>

					<title>Building Web Apps using Dojo with Michael Van Sickle</title>

					<pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Michael Van Sickle about developing web applications using the Dojo Toolkit. Not heard of it? You're not alone, but Dojo has been around since 2006! Michael talks about Dojo's focus on backward compatibility, making sure that web applications built with the framework continue to function as HTML, Javascript and CSS evolve. Heck, Dojo started before HTML 5 browsers were even available! If you're concerned about the longevity of your web applications, you should check out Dojo. </description>

					<title>Actor Models in Akka.NET with Roger Alsing</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1058</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Roger Alsing about Akka.NET, a library to help you build concurrent and distributed applications. Akka.NET is a port of Akka for Java, and is open source on GitHub. As Roger explains, Akka.NET uses the actor model to create a level of abstraction ideal for building concurrent applications. This is similar to the Orleans Framework from show 969, but with some distinct advantages. The conversation gets into how folks focus on object orientation can struggle with concurrency and Akka.NET solves these problems differently that TPL and reactive extensions. </description>

					<title>Digging into Xamarin Forms with Laurent Bugnion</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1057</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Laurent Bugnion about Xamarin Forms. Now that the forms capability has been out for a few months, Laurent digs into the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. The goal of Xamarin forms is to simplify cross-platform mobile development between iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Has it delivered? Laurent focuses in on building one project, but different builds with different bits of code for each device. You can't have one code base run everywhere, nor do you want to - there's still a need for tailoring for each device, but Xamarin Forms makes that smaller and simpler.</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Brian Randell about the latest on Visual Studio Online (VSO). As Brian explains, this isn't about putting Visual Studio itself into the cloud, but rather surrounding your copy of Visual Studio with services in the cloud that make development easier. The conversation goes down the list, starting with source control in general and TFS specifically. One huge advantage of VSO - you don't have to deploy TFS yourself! Beyond source control and task management there are deployment tools and testing, all of which can be run in the cloud, where you're only billed for what you use. This is modern development at it's finest!</description>

					<description>While at the NSBConf in Brooklyn, New York, Carl and Richard moderated a panel of Udi Dahan, Ted Neward, Oren Eini and Yves Goeleven about the future of the service bus. And the future is bright! Without much contention, the panel focused in on the advantages of message passing and creating coherent boundaries between application layers to make scaling and management much easier when building large applications. There is also a discussion about rendering the update of components asynchronous, so that not everyone has to be ready to upgrade at the same time - less big bang, more continuous delivery!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jen Myers about user interface design on the web. The conversation starts out with a broad focus on what has been happening on the web with HTML 5 - the emergence of the Single Page Application (SPA) and the improvements on separation of data, structure and formatting. Jen focuses in on the challenges of the least mature of the trifecta of web applications - CSS. CSS is only at version 3; HTML and JavaScript are older and more mature. And while CSS3 is a pretty good version, there are still challenges there and there are tools to address them.</description>

Carl and Richard get giddy geeky with the amazing Dr. Amber Straughn who is part of the Project Science team for the James Webb Space Telescope. Considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, Amber talks about how the JWST is bigger and different - with a six meter reflector and orbiting 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. The conversation digs into why the JWST is looking into the infrared spectrum, what the cosmological red shift is all about and a whole ton of other amazing concepts around what it means to look back in time to near the beginning of the universe!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Miguel Castro about his work building modern web pages for his clients. After a couple of years working hard on WPF applications, coming over to the web world was a challenge - but as Miguel discovered, the MVVM pattern he used in WPF apps works great on the web as well! Miguel talks about working with Knockout and other libraries on his way to discovering a comfortable pattern of development using AngularJS and ASP.NET MVC together. That's right, using ASP.NET MVC to do MVVM page design! Miguel talks about how his approach to web pages creates something testable and maintainable, which is what you look for in a great business web site.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jeff Palermo about building new applications without making the mistakes that end up creating legacy projects. The conversation starts out with Jeff describing ClearMeasure, his new organization focused on end-to-end services for his customers - Jeff considers his organization an outsourced IT department, handling development and operations. This leads to the topic of building sustainable applications. Jeff details key steps he takes to make better quality applications, many of which are simple steps like keeping individual code files small, having create source control and a plan for using that source control properly. He also talks about getting the infrastructure right at the beginning so that it's an asset to building software, not a liability. And when it comes to selecting technology for the project, the key measure is the certainty of success. Business software is pretty well understood these days, how do you build it as cost-effectively and reliably as possible?</description>

					<description>While at the NSBConf in Brooklyn, Carl and Richard talk to Oren Eini about the latest version of RavenDB. Oren talks about the huge number of changes that have happened in version 3 of RavenDB - it's come a long way from a little transactional document store of years ago! The conversation digs into how the feature set was developed; Oren talks about digging into various customer projects to see how they have pushed his product in ways he had never considered before. The discussion also digs into other document stores, including Microsoft's recently announced Azure DocumentDB - and Oren is not that impressed, but it *is* a preview after all. Oren also talks about his views on MongoDB and what its strengths and weaknesses are. There are lots of different ways to store data, and you can pick the one that is right for you... there is no one way to do it!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Kate Gregory is back! Carl and Richard chat with Kate about the state of C++ today. The conversation starts out with a discussion about the recent C++ conference in Redmond that brought the best-and-brightest in the industry together to talk about how C++ is currently being used and how the standards can continue to evolve. Kate talks about the challenges of the language, how it is not typically used for CRUD apps, but rather applications that live on rovers on Mars, in games, in drivers, operating systems and a whole host of diverse platforms. That's what makes C++ amazing, it's everywhere! The discussion continues on how C++ does continue to evolve, adapt the best ideas from other language (looking at you, lambdas!) and today's code is dramatically different from just a few years ago.

					<title>Building Big MVC Projects with Jimmy Bogard</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1046</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jimmy Bogard about his experiences scaling an MVC web site to thousands of pages and thousands of users. The conversation starts out focused on why to use MVC - comparing original ASP with ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. Jimmy talks about the early days of MVC and the challenges of making a very new product work, but in exchange for some substantial benefits - but perhaps not the ones you'd think! Jimmy also digs into scaling an MVC web site across multiple servers, dealing with state management (Session is evil!) and what you can do to web pages to keep them performing well with large numbers of users. The discussion also moves to managing huge number of pages and developing patterns for UI and object naming to simplify development and testing. Automation is key when you're working at scale!</description>

					<title>Battling Technical Debt while Keeping the Lights On with Jim Holmes</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1045</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jim Holmes about managing technical debt - while still getting your work done. The conversation starts out talking about what exactly technical debt is... it's not just the code you're afraid of! Jim also digs into the business justification for reducing technical debt, focused on how you can show the cost of your technical debt in the form of tech support or how it slows down the development of new features. Once you've got cycles for mitigating technical debt, how do you go about it? Remember that this was the code you were afraid of in the first place, so tackling it takes time and care to do well. Jim digs into how to split your time between new features (and keep the lights on) as well as retiring the technical debt in your organization. After all, getting too deeply in debt is also a way to turn out the lights on your business - you need a plan to fight back!</description>

					<title>CQRS Update with Udi Dahan</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1044</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the NSBCon in Brooklyn, New York, Carl and Richard talk to Udi Dahan about CQRS. CQRS is the acronym for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation. Udi begins the conversation talking a bit about the history of CQRS and how it derived from Bertrand Meyer's work on CQS back in the 80s. The cornerstone of CQRS is a separation between commands (insert/update/delete) and querying in databases - not just relational databases, of course, but certainly the focus is there. The power of the pattern is its ability to handle huge volumes of data in both directions, simplifying application design as the load increases. Great thinking from Udi as usual!</description>

					<title>Tax and Coders with Steve DelBianco</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1043</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Steve DelBianco about taxation and software development - including the new Marketplace Fairness Act. But first the focus is on the history of sales tax, which as Steve explains, is focused on physical goods transacted in person. The first crisis of sales tax came in the 30s when catalog sales became popular and more consumers starting buying products from other states. This presents the idea of Use Tax, effective a self-declared sales tax collection process for good you buy out-of-state. Yeah, that's right, you're suppose to assess sales tax on yourself! Steve has been involved for more than a decade in the effort to modernize sales taxes to handle internet sales, which leads to the current situation around the Marketplace Fairness Act - which is not at all what the name should be. The states are trying to garner the right to collect taxes and demand from anyone in any state - and this law might actually pass! Check out the links below for ways to make your voice heard.</description>

					<title>Hybrid Mobile Development Update with Lino Tadros</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1042</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Lino Tadros about his viewpoint on doing mobile development using the plethora of cross-platform development tools available today. First up - Xamarin's tools for building iOS and Android apps. Windows Phone also makes an appearance, especially with Xamarin Forms. The Xamarin stack continues to evolve and improve, and Lino is pretty impressed. Then it's over to the HTML/JavaScript world of Adobe Cordova, with implementations in Visual Studio as well as the Telerik Platform. Lino talks about its strengths around working beyond even the three top mobile platforms for when you really want to deal with the long tail, but the implementations vary a bit, leading to the ecosystem of plugins to fill in the gaps. Both these approaches work, Lino focuses in on the skillsets needed, and reminds of the reality - there is no cross-platform solution out there that doesn't demand you understand the platforms you're working with.</description>

					<title>Making .NET Perform with Ben Watson</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1041</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Ben Watson about his work around writing high performance .NET code. Ben talks about how the Bing team decided to use .NET code internally, which seems like an obvious choice for a Microsoft group, but it isn't really - when milliseconds count, does .NET makes sense? Ben says it does, and he's done the work to prove it. Ben's book "Writing High Performance .NET Code" focuses not only on coding techniques, but also the larger practice of having a deep understanding of how .NET works, and the processes that take place to turn .NET code into machine code. The conversation also digs deeply into the need for performance measurement, especially Event Tracing for Windows. .NET can be fast when you do it right!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Mårten Rånge about his efforts to contribute to the open source project that is F#. F# is really open source and taking public contributions, but as Mårten explains, it's not that simple. You need to get engaged with the project on CodePlex and actually get to know the team and where the project is at to hope to make a difference there. As Mårten says, everyone is very nice, but they do have a vision of where the project is going - and you can contribute to that vision! The conversation digs into what it takes to actually build your own version of F# as well as the art of making a contribution to a project that will ultimately be delivered in Visual Studio. This is just the start for Mårten, and perhaps for you also!</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Trevan Hetzel about writing CSS code to do JavaScript work in modern web pages. When you're a coder, you tend to code. When you're a designer, you're more likely to style. Trevan discusses the many things that CSS can do that most coders tend to write JavaScript for instead. And once you see what's possible in CSS, the question drills in on - is this a good idea? Are we writing JavaScript that is better served as a behaviour in a style? Where do you want your stuff to live? Trevan also digs into a bunch of great tools for taking your CSS to a higher level, check them out in the show notes!</description>

The conversation starts out with a recap of Node itself, how it takes on the web services problem with a minimal footprint at first, and how you can add in the bits you need with the Node Packaged Manager. Then Mike digs into Sails.js, an MVC framework to help you build well-structure web pages in JavaScript against Node on the backend - JavaScript everywhere! The discussion also deals with the state of the Node community, including the announced departure of TJ Holowaychuk, one of the most prolific Node library developers out there. Node is moving into the mainstream, have you checked it out? Lots of links below!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Once more into the breech for the last of the fusion power GeekOuts, at least for now. Carl and Richard dive into the most controversial aspect of fusion power, so-called "cold fusion." This is a sensitive topic in the scientific community, so much so that it's name changes on a regular basis. The current popular name is Low Energy Nuclear Reactions. And the name is a big deal - Richard starts off the conversation by digging into the idea that there is more than one kind of cold fusion. Then the history lesson starts, with a study of what led up to the dramatic announcement by Fleischmann and Pons in March of 1989 - and the catastrophic fallout that led to the concept of "pathological science" and forcing it essentially underground. So what's real and what is snake oil? Is there something to cold fusion after all? The answers, as always, are complex and interesting!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard chat with IdeaBlade man Ward Bell about the latest in Breeze and the whole concept of building web clients that can function in a disconnected state. It's possible with modern browsers to store information locally, which can help your web app survive an intermittent connection. Ward talks about how Breeze, his open source tool for caching, validation and querying, helps solve the disconnected problem. The challenge is finding the right patterns of development so that you don't have to litter your code with connectivity testing, just handle failures when they come without losing the user's work. Easy, right?</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Kathleen Dollard about her deep dive into Roslyn. The conversation starts out with a great question from a listener about using Roslyn to step into the compiler and understand how syntax trees would look... and what the potential for visualization is. Kathleen talks about her own open source project RoslynDom to help understand what's going on inside of Roslyn. The discussion also gets into some of the cool new capabilities coming in the next version of Visual Studio, and how Microsoft has changed the shipping process entirely - it's not the Studio you once knew!</description>

The discussion also gets into some of the cool new capabilities coming in the next version of Visual Studio, and how Microsoft has changed the shipping process entirely - it's not the Studio you once knew!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Gathering Requirements with Robert Bogue</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1034</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Robert Bogue about the adventure that is requirements gathering. The conversation starts out with a sharing of war stories, talking about finding the right people to talk to in order to understand the overall application requirements in general, much less individual specifications. Robert talks a bit about a variety of techniques for requirements gathering, referencing some of the Agile Manifesto in the process, but recognizing that requirements themselves are largely methodology independent - it just takes relentless investigation and a goal of thoroughly understanding the system. Check out Robert's videos on Pluralsight!</description>

					<title>Web Forms for Mobile with Paul Sheriff</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1033</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Paul Sheriff about his work building mobile web apps using ASP.NET WebForms. Yeah, that's right, WebForms! Paul talks about the problems with WebForms and how they can be overcome with some careful configuration and understanding of how WebForms really works. The conversation digs into adding Responsive Web Design to a WebForms page to make it work well on a mobile browser using Twitter's BootStrap - and also how to use WrapBootStrap to make your pages not look like BootStrap pages. Not every mobile web app should be a WebForms app, but it makes sense in some cases - Paul compares approaches to help you choose!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Dan Wahlin about his latest open source project, building a Single Page Application (SPA) using AngularJS interfacing with Microsoft Azure Active Directory Services (MAAD) and Office 365 API. Called OfficeDev and published on GitHub, this project demonstrates interacting with Office documents, Sharepoint and traditional enterprise authentication systems from within a browser. Dan discusses the thinking behind the project and some of the more challenging parts to it - but you can check all that out for yourself on GitHub, the code is all published.</description>

					<description>Time for some more IoT! Pete Brown checks in with Carl and Richard to talk about Microsoft's continuing announcements in the Internet of Things space. The conversation starts out with a discussion about Pete's work in the music side of things and the Windows 8 API for MIDI - helping musicians use a Windows 8 tablet as the hub of a music system. Then it's on to several important announcements, including the implementation of C# with the Intel Galileo board, and the announcement of two new hardware platforms: SharksCove, which is essentially a tablet-sized prototyping platform and MinnowBoard, a Arduino-sized board running actual Intel hardware and capable of running a full version of Windows and .NET! The hardware is getting amazing, and your .NET skills are even more valuable!</description>

					<title>Building IoS Apps Using Swift with Glenn Howes</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1030</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Glenn Howes about Apple's new programming language for IoS and MacOS: Swift. As Glenn explains, Swift builds on the same compiler that Apple's Objective-C uses (LLVM), but optimizes a number of key aspects that were known to be slow. Swift goes beyond performance improvements to add language features like generics, type safety and more! The conversation also digs into the future of Swift running on Mac OS X as well, which then digs into the differences between apps on the iPad and apps on the Mac. Great Apple conversation!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Bill Wagner about some of the features coming in C# 6.0. The conversation starts with the history - the internal Microsoft project known as Roslyn has become an open source project on Codeplex. Bill runs down a number of cool features coming in C# 6.0, including primary constructors, improvements to Await and more. No idea when the shipping date is, but C# 6.0 is in the Visual Studio 2014 CTPs and is available for download any time you like!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to GitHub denizen and former Microsoftie Phil Haack about what it means to build open source software. The conversation starts off with a reminder that back in Phil's Microsoft days, he was a huge advocate of taking various Microsoft products open source - and today it's actually happening! Phil may have moved on to GitHub, but the spirit of open source has permeated the web team at Microsoft, the ultimate manifestation being ASP.NET vNext! So what about your projects? What does it takes to make them open source, and what benefits can you expect?</description>

					<pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard circle back with Mark Miller for a whirlwind discussion on the biology of user interface design. Actually, it's the biology of humans as it relates to UI, focusing (no pun intended) on the eyes - how exactly does eyesight work? What cultural and psychological conditioning affects how you see? And ultimately, how can we apply the understanding of eyesight to make applications that are easier to use, easier to understand, and more enjoyable? Mark has years of experience in building great UI, and has distilled the core elements down to the biology of the user!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Daniel Piessens about building continuous delivery solutions. The conversation starts out with an explanation of the differences between continuous integration, deployment, and delivery - and the fact that there are business decisions to deal with there, not just technical decisions! Daniel also digs into the challenges around getting Operations deeply involved in the testing process so that they have control over features as they are developed and can be turned off and on of your canary servers when needed. Lots of cool thinking about the future of software development with DevOps practices.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Denise Jacobs about creativity. Denise starts out talking about her work with developers, mostly focused around understanding just how creative the software development process is. The conversation digs into the idea that flow state, which has been a talking point in a number of shows of late... is it inherently a creative state? Denise also digs into the battle with your internal critic, how to stop that critic from holding you back. Lots of personal empowerment thoughts, writing your goals down, experiments with improv, and more - it's a creative world!</description>

The conversation starts out with a reference to a comment made on a previous show about the problems with web apps not being built well enough for your device - that they feel too webby. And Chris agrees - it's very challenging to build a web app that feels great on a mobile device. So what's the problem? Chris digs deep into what it takes to make web pages render fast and clean on phones and the biggest bugbear of them all - building a great, compatible touch interface for a web app on a mobile device.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Julie Lerman and Steve Smith about the fundamentals of Domain Driven Design (DDD). Julie and Steve have collaborated on a very popular Pluralsight course about DDD that has made the methodology more approachable for more people. The conversation digs into the fact that DDD has been around for more than a decade, but hasn't caught on near as much as it should - and why is that? There's at least one alphabet soup moment: What about DDD, BDD, TDD, PDD, ADDDD and SJDD? Listen to the show for definitions of these acronyms and more! </description>

					<description>Well, here we go - the second installation of the fusion power geek out. While the first show focused on the "Big Science" fusion power projects like NIF and ITER, this time around Richard digs into smaller hybrid projects, like General Fusions Magnetized Target Fusion as well as Colliding Beam Fusion Reactors being built by Helion Energy and Tri Alpha Energy. These fusion approaches combine magnetic and inertial plasma confinement to make fusion a little less extreme and more manageable - with more focus on how to actually make electricity. Also, they seem to be funded by tech billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen. Is that a good thing or bad? Is this stuff all snake oil? There's more to talk about!</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1021</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Scott Hunter about how Microsoft is working to evolve web development for ASP.NET developers. While the focus of the discussion is on ASP.NET vNext, you can't talk web without also talking cloud, and that means Azure. Scott digs into many of the new features in Azure that can make a web developer's life easier, before digging into ASP.NET vNext. No punches are pulled - vNext represents some breaking changes, especially for web forms developers. But web forms continues to be supported and added to in future versions of ASP.NET, just not at the rate that vNext is capable of. ASP.NET developers? Have a listen!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Dan Rosenstein about his work bringing the Windows Developer Program for Internet of Things (IoT) to life. The conversation starts out with a discussion about Microsoft's focus on IoT and the recognition that this a thing that is happening, and developers need tools to be productive. Dan focuses on the work Microsoft has done with Intel's Galileo device, which can work with Arduino, but uses a full x86 chipset. And while there isn't .NET available for the system yet, "one could speculate" that this is coming. Check out the links below to get involved!</description>

					<title>Building Mobile Web Apps with Rick Strahl</title>

					<pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Rick Strahl about his latest efforts to build mobile web applications. The conversation starts out with a recap of the continuing debate about native vs web on mobile devices. As Rick says, there are no easy answers there. Every approach to cross-platform development (and different browsers on different phones represent different platforms) have compromises that need to be made. There is no "one size fits all" available. But the web continues to evolve, and Rick is optimistic that it is all coming together. Also, check out his open source, free-to-download web load testing tool!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Mike Wood about migrating your applications to Azure. The conversation starts out thinking through the fundamentals of working in the cloud - how architecture and deployment are different. This inevitably leads to the hardest debate: Is your organization okay with data in the cloud? After that, Mike gets into some of the more interesting angles on cloud development - actually using virtual machines for your development environment. Is it cloud or is it virtual? Is there a difference? And a great list of resources for getting started with Azure!</description>

					<title>Psychology in Programming with Adam Tornhill</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1016</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Adam Tornhill about his work understanding the psychology of programming. The conversation starts out with some thinking around getting into "the flow," being able to focus effectively on programming. Adam then digs into where bugs come from and the role of complexity in code. He has been studying code repositories to determine where bugs are likely to appear based on the idea that complex code changes more than simple code. The discussion also explores the idea that while coding parallel code is challenging, parallel development is even harder - can you really get multiple people working on the same project at the same time? You think you do, but do you really! Time to study your source tracking system!</description>

					<title>Modern App Development with Rocky Lhotka</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1015</link>
					<pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Rocky Lhotka about what it means to build modern apps today. In past shows, Rocky has been pretty frustrated with the native development options and focused primarily on web development with HTML 5 and JavaScript. But things on the native side have gotten better, and Rocky talks about his experiences with Xamarin and the potential of the universal app template in Visual Studio. Could native be making a comeback? Rocky talks about the advantages of the native model with cross-platform development techniques and a sense of an improving future. It's a fun time to be a developer!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Jeff Fritz about ASP.NET vNext - and yes, ASP.NET is now open source! So what does that really mean for ASP.NET developers? Jeff digs into the impact of taking open source on the development process of ASP.NET and how we can all get more involved! This leads to a discussion about the expanding reach of .NET into other platforms such as Linux using OWIN and Katana, and the Microsoft stack being a friendly place for developers of all kinds to hang out. Azure is also a big part of the future web story, and Jeff digs into the cloud-optimized stack and how you can get your web app there.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>In what is likely to become a multi-part series, Richard and Carl chat about fusion power, focused on the "hot" side of fusion - megaprojects like the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). But first, a review of what is actually involved in fusing atoms together and how it differs from fission (as discussed in the older nuclear power shows. Richard then delves into a quick history lesson of power demand and why we need fusion as well as the stories of the first nuclear fusion projects before hitting the big time: NIF and ITER. Do they work? Will they work? Does it make sense? What is the impact of Big Science (tm) on getting science actually done?</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Atley Hunter about how he monetizes phone apps. A newcomer to .NET Rocks, Atley was a regular guest on the TabletShow and has talked about monetization before - but now he's learned even more techniques! Atley talks about the advantages of in-app purchases over try-before-you-buy, as well as asking for donations. He also digs into the idea that you can offer a variety of prices and how to encourage your customers to spend more! Lots of great thinking on how to make an income from your apps from one of the masters!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Daniel Simmons about his work with PasTrak, building RFID tools for small businesses. The first half of the conversation focuses on what RFID is all about - different types of tags, scanners, security concerns, and so on. There's a lot of choice out there when it comes to RFID and its cousin Near Field Communications (NFC). Then Danny digs into the coding side of things - the various APIs you work with to handle different readers, how your code responds, how to deal with duplicate data and data overload...all the fun things that happen when you interact with the real world!</description>

David starts out the conversation talking about the shortage of developers today, and how the shortage is getting worse, not better. This leads to a conversation about existing training approaches, such as a four-year computer science degree. While we all agree that the best way to learn to program is to actually program, what are the best tools to start out with? How do you get out into the industry and continue to grow?</description>

This leads to a conversation about team building, creating trust within the team and dealing with remote workers - how do you create trust when you can't see each other. Then there's the process of recruiting and interviewing, where Michelle focuses on the interaction with the team even more than technical skills. Great teams don't just happen, but how much management does a great development team need? </description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>On the last day of the NDC 2014 Conference in Oslo, Carl and Richard assembled a panel of speakers: Robert Virding, Steve Sanderson, Venkat Subramaniam, and Anthony Eden. The discussion focused initially on the motivations around building software, but ultimately evolved into the best way to build sustainable software. Is the profit motive for software development a good one? What about open source? How do you know when your software is 'done?' How do you decide what features to add and what to leave out or even remove? Great thinking from a remarkable set of minds!</description>

					<title>Web Security Breaches with Troy Hunt</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1005</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC, Carl and Richard chat with Troy Hunt about specific common web security breaches and things you can do about them. The conversation starts out with a continuation of an earlier show, talking about the vulnerabilities around open WiFi connections. From there, Troy talks about the most common breach of them all - SQL Injection. Yes, it's still a problem. Troy also digs into the importance of transport layer security, typically using SSL. There's a reason all the big web sites have switched to HTTPS all of the time. Maybe it's something you should consider also?</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC is Oslo, Carl and Richard talk to Martin Jul about the state of visual computing technology today. As Martin says, the future is very bright - amazing free libraries are now available that make it simple to do image and character recognition with all sorts of cameras, even one on the Raspberry PI! The conversation digs into a project that Martin built to identify when the pizza guy is at his front door, exploring what it takes to recognize a pizza box in video. There are digital cameras everywhere today, shouldn't we be building apps to take advantage of them?</description>

					<description>While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard talked to Nik Molnar and Anthony van der Hoorn about instrumenting web application. Of course the conversation starts out with a catch-up on Glimpse, the awesome session-based instrumentation tool for your web pages. Then the conversation moves to looking at instrumentation end-to-end on web applications, in the aggregate, so that you can see where your pain points are and where to focus your attention on tuning. Nik talks about starting at the high level view point so that you focus on the right things - it's not always about the code!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Paul Stovell, one of the principals behind Octopus Deploy. Octopus Deploy is all about getting your organization to continuous delivery - by automating every step. Paul talks about how the product came to be, from the frustrations he was having with deployment using Word documents and remote desktop. Octopus Deploy is free to download and use for small projects. Once you're addicted to one-button deployment, you can pay for larger projects and teams. And under the hood, it's technologies like PowerSshell that make it all work. This is a great addition to your DevOps toolkit.</description>

					<title>Getting into the Zone with Mark Seemann</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=1001</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo, Norway, Carl and Richard talk with Mark Seemann about his thinking around how developers 'get into the zone.' As Mark explains, this behavior isn't all that unusual - psychologists call it 'flow,' and it is a common state for athletes, musicians, writers and more. The conversation digs into the truth around flow, primarily that it doesn't guarantee productivity. Mark discusses techniques for getting into flow faster, so that you're less sensitive to interruption, and the conversation ultimately spins into thinking around how we can practice more effectively using flow and put in the hours it takes to become truly proficient in our area of focus. Throughout the conversation there are references to great books you should read - check the links!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Forte about the continuing evolution of wearables and their role in the workplace. The conversation starts out focused on the most visible of the wearables today - Google Glass. Does it have a role in the enterprise? That's a tricky concept. Steve talks about retail and more industrial applications, places where workers in motion get additional contextual information to improve their work. Human instrumentation is a big part of the wearable market as well, like FitBit. Steve talks about making sure workers move enough - not sitting too long, not walking too far, and so on. And there's more instrumentation to talk about, check out the links in the show notes!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Well here we go - a tough geek out topic if ever there was one. The most requested Geek Out we haven't done yet: nuclear weapons! Starting back before World War II, Richard digs into the science history that created the first proposals for nuclear weapons. The war ultimately provided the catalyst in the form of the Manhattan Project, culminating in the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Then the story continues into thermonuclear weapons and other variations. What defense is there against nukes? And what about non-proliferation and arms reductions treaties? How safe is the world today from nukes?</description>

					<description>While at NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Michael 'Doc' Norton about his experiences figuring out the right metrics to measure in productivity of a development team. The discussion focuses in on the key issue - that velocity is a dangerous metric. As Doc explains, pushing developers to do more features per sprint creates serious problems. So what measures make sense? Great thinking around what makes people productive, what impairs productivity, and how to do the right things the right way. </description>

					<description>While at NDC in Oslo, Carl and Richard talked to Bryan Hunter about his experiences building communities around functional programming. Bryan talks about the transformative moment he had first encountering functional code in the form of an Erlang service. The conversation digs into the thinking around the weaknesses of object orientation, it's motivations and the idea that maybe, today, it is obsolete. Is functional programming really the way? Bryan discusses how communities are forming around functional that are inspiring and forward thinking. Maybe it's time for a change?</description>

As Chris explains, Xamarin.Forms brings a XAML-like experience to building forms for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. The conversation focuses in on what Xamarin.Forms is best suited for, when you should stick to the standard class based tools for building clients, and what it takes to have 100% code sharing. Is it worth it? Depends! Chris also digs into the role of MVVMCross in Xamarin development as well as Xamarin Test Cloud and University. Cool stuff from the Xamarin team as usual!</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=990</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Clemens Vasters about his latest work at Microsoft around making the Internet of Things (IoT). Clemens starts with a definition of IoT, describing massive numbers of devices sharing data seamlessly... and confusing people at the same time. What's an IoT device and what isn't? The conversation digs into the challenges around connectivity, thinking through the architecture and security necessary to deal with huge numbers of occasionally connected devices with data demands - such as cars! The foundations are being laid to bring IoT to life, have you got your head around the ideas?</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Christian Weyer about his experiences working with cloud technologies in Germany. The conversation starts out pretty grim, digging into how the NSA revelations have chilled interest in cloud technology because of security and privacy concerns. Christian talks about how the technology of Azure is more compelling than ever, but customers just aren't willing to use it. This leads to a conversation about Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server, which brings many Azure technologies to your own internal networks. There's a number of different ways to use Windows Azure Pack, including as a self-service portal to provide testing infrastructure for developers - talk to your ops folks and try it out!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Francesco Balena about migrating VB6 applications to .NET. Yes, that's still happening! With Microsoft ending support for Windows XP in April 2014, folks that have been hanging onto old platforms and applications are taking another look at migrating. Francesco makes an amazing tool called VB Migration Partner that analyzes VB6 apps to identify what parts of an application can be converted into VB.NET (or C#) and what parts need to be rewritten. While migration is never simple, Francesco provides great advice on how to make it possible. Still got some VB6 in your life?</description>

					<title>Service Bus Update with Udi Dahan</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=975</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Udi Dahan about the state of NServiceBus. NServiceBus is Udi's on-going development effort to make the development and maintenance of complex, distributed systems easier. The conversation digs into how developers fall into the N+1 trap of adding more and more interactions between different applications until the system becomes unmanageable - or force the interaction to take place at the very back end of the system, like the database, leading to slow interactions and complexity in the database that shouldn't be there. Whether you use NServiceBus or not, Udi's thinking on bus-based application design will open your eyes!</description>

Zoiner talks about using a wide variety of features in Google Analytics to instrument his Azure apps, including going directly to the Analytics APIs to do instrumentation of other kinds of apps, connecting up just about anything that can speak HTTP! The second half of the conversation dives into utilizing this analysis - with a long chat about what a real Minimal Viable Product means and how the Lean Startup principles can be abused.

					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Brian Noyes about the state of affairs with WPF, Windows 8 and the Prism project. Brian starts out the conversation talking about WPF is far from dead - Microsoft continues to invest in it, and lots of folks, including Brian's customers, are building great applications with WPF. This leads to a discussion about how the changes to Windows 8 at Build affect the WPF story and development in general - a huge topic area that warrants a bunch more shows. Finally, Brian digs into Prism, Microsoft Patterns and Practice group toolset for building great Windows apps for all sorts of versions of Windows, including Windows 8. Prism has moved beyond Silverlight, and is worth a serious look!</description>

The focus is on personally identifiable information - what is it, how do you handle it, how do you protect it, when does it become too risky to keep. Good thinking around data protection!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Marcel de Vries about CodedUI - the test functionality built into Visual Studio that nobody knows about. CodedUI tests are tests built to automatically operate your UI so that you can test your application top-to-bottom, no short cuts. Marcel talks about how CodedUI tests are actually built using a test recorder and then tweaking the tests to increase coverage. You can build tables of data to use for entry to challenge boundary testing, add additional assertions and validations - it's very clever! If you own Visual Studio 2013, you need to check this out!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Micheal Learned about modern release management with Visual Studio. The conversation starts like many do when it comes to ALM: what's hard, and what's easy. And let's face it - releasing software properly is often hard! Micheal talks about the various pitfalls that folks fall into around releasing software and how today's environment just won't tolerate those mistakes any more. This leads to a discussion about release pipelines (check out the great doc in the show notes) and Microsoft's acquisition of InRelease by InCycle Software. If you've got an MSDN license, you have to take a look at Release Management! And if you don't, take the trial out for a spin, it's worth it!</description>

The conversation starts like many do when it comes to ALM: what's hard, and what's easy. And let's face it - releasing software properly is often hard! Micheal talks about the various pitfalls that folks fall into around releasing software and how today's environment just won't tolerate those mistakes any more. This leads to a discussion about release pipelines (check out the great doc in the show notes) and Microsoft's acquisition of InRelease by InCycle Software. If you've got an MSDN license, you have to take a look at Release Management! And if you don't, take the trial out for a spin, it's worth it!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Nuclear Accidents Geek Out</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=960</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Well, you knew this was coming - a geek out on the not-fun topic of nuclear accidents. Richard runs down the fundamentals of nuclear accidents, with some story telling around what happened at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Then on to the main event - Fukushima. The situation is serious, but progress is being made and the Japanese remain committed to fully cleaning up the mess made there. So is nuclear power worth the risk? Be part of this conversation; it's certainly not done yet!</description>

					<title>Usability Testing with Amber DeRosa and Alicia Hatter</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=959</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Amber DeRosa and Alicia Hatter about usability testing. The conversation starts out by digging into what usability testing is all about - actually looking at how users are using your software... or perhaps would want to use your software. Amber and Alicia talk about working through usability studies even before the software is built to get a feel for what the user would really like. And while software is being built, routine testing digs deeper into how the software will be used, what users actually like to do with it and how that can affect the final product. The discussion also digs into the dynamic between the developers, QA, project management and usability testing - they all have important roles in building great software!</description>

					<title>Are you a Craftsman with Alan Stevens</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=958</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Alan Stevens about his views on software craftsmanship. Well, if he just agreed with it, it wouldn't be much of a show now, would it? Alan starts off talking about what it really means to be a craftsman - referencing such wonderful talents as Kevin Ryan Guitars and Steinway pianos as examples. This leads to a discussion about function, construction method and artistry - they're all part of making anything great. The conversation also digs into the whole medieval guild model that software appears to be grabbing onto, with apprenticeships, journeymen and masters. Does it make sense? Does it keep us humble? Does it really ship better software? </description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Rob Conery about his open source project called Biggy. Biggy is a project in GitHub that puts a wrapper over top of Postgres (and SQL Server for that matter) to allow you to handle documents (aka JSON) efficiently and fast. Rob takes on thinking around noSQL in general, including graph and document databases. This leads to a whole discussion on what we should store and why. Rob mentions a ton of cool GitHub projects around storage (links in the show notes), and how much fun it is to be a developer today.</description>

					<description>While at the ModernApps2013 event in Mountain View, California, Carl and Richard got a chance to sit down with David Chappell and get his views on the changing landscape of software and software development. David talks about how applications have evolved into a devices+services model, where parts of the application live in the cloud, and the rest live in the various form factor devices that we all now use. Later the conversation turns to the evolution of Application Lifecycle Management, with concepts like Continuous Delivery and DevOps becoming essential skills for the modern developer. Great thoughts from an awesome thinker in our industry!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Hilton Giesenow down in South Africa about what it takes to build real enterprise-class SharePoint systems. Hilton talks about the history of SharePoint and how it's twists-and-turns have left a bad taste in the mouth of some developers. The conversation also digs into the infrastructure side, which is unavoidable when it comes to SharePoint - there are lots of moving parts, and someone has to take charge of them. If you're keen on SharePoint, you owe it to yourself to have a listen to Hilton's own podcast, The Moss Show!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Time to Geek Out on Direct Current! Carl and Richard talk about the recent wave of discussion about DC in the home. Blame USB for part of it - everyone is using USB to charge devices now, and USB was never meant to do that... but in 2014, the new USB Power Delivery standard will be implemented to make it more effective. Richard digs into his experiences switching over to LED lighting in his house, and the craziness around converting from AC to DC at every LED light.

					<itunes:summary>Time to Geek Out on Direct Current! Carl and Richard talk about the recent wave of discussion about DC in the home. Blame USB for part of it - everyone is using USB to charge devices now, and USB was never meant to do that... but in 2014, the new USB Power Delivery standard will be implemented to make it more effective. Richard digs into his experiences switching over to LED lighting in his house, and the craziness around converting from AC to DC at every LED light. So what about distributed LED lighting in the house? It opens the door to many more DC based solutions!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Getting AngularJS with Dan Wahlin</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=944</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the Irvine stop of the ModernApps2013 road trip, Carl and Richard talk to Dan Wahlin about getting started with AngularJS. The discussion digs into the variety of JavaScript libraries out there today and how Dan has shifted his skills from a much more C# centric world into a more JavaScript world. The interplay of the libraries is an important discussion, as well as thoughts about when NOT to use technologies like AngularJS - as well as when there are times that these tools provide a huge advantage. And prepare for some CSS bashing!</description>

					<description>At the beginning of the west coast leg of the ModernApps2013 road trip, Carl and Richard talk to Julie Lerman about the latest features of Entity Framework in Visual Studio 2013. Julie talks about the improvements made in EF6, the version of Entity Framework that ships 'alongside' Visual Studio 2013. The focus is on code-first data interaction, but along the way Richard puts on his DBA app and complains. The conversation digs into performance, tuning and creating maintainable data that works well with EF. And most importantly, Julie discusses how Entity Framework is now entirely open source and on CodePlex! More great thoughts from Julie!</description>

					<description>At the Houston #ModernApps2013 Road Trip stop, Carl and Richard talk to Justin Searls about using Javascript in the enterprise. Besides referencing an awesome number of tools around Javascript (check out the huge list of links!), Justin focuses in on how enterprise's often ignore the actual care and feeding of Javascript code within their organization. While he's certainly taken advantage of that ignorance, better that we all figure out how to treat Javascript like a first class language citizen with source control, testing and proper management. You know, like a real language!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>The day before the US Road Trip started in Boston, Carl and Richard sat down with Bill Wagner to talk about the latest version of TypeScript. But first Bill talked about Humanitarian Toolbox, a charity building open source software for disaster relief organizations that he and Richard are deeply involved in. Then the conversation turned to TypeScript, a language for bringing types, classes and modules to Javascript. Originally a separate installation off of GitHub, TypeScript is part of Visual Studio 2013. Bill talks about the challenges of building maintainable Javascript and how TypeScript makes things better!</description>

					<title>Programmer Anarchy Created by Fred George</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=928</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Fred George about implementing programmer anarchy in your organization. This is the good form of anarchy - the kind that focuses on self-organization, rather than blowing things up. Fred talks about the roles of management in software, and which ones make sense and which one don't... and how developers can take over those roles in conjunction with development. Autonomy and mastery, that's what keeps developers motivated!</description>

					<description>While at Øredev in Malmö, Sweden, Carl and Richard talk to Rachel Reese about her fun with F#. Rachel's background in mathematics led her to experiment with functional languages like Erlang and F#, and ultimately to solve problems more effectively utilizing techniques like parallelism from F#. The conversation also explores the actor model (and agents, and a bunch of other Hollywood terms) as well as the cool new type providers that are in F# 3.0. Another huge F# fan - have you taken it out for a spin yet?</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Matt Wynne about Cucumber, a tool for building requirement statements that are actually testable in your development environment. Matt starts out with a discussion about behavior driven development and how Cucumber evolved as a way to not only capture behaviors effectively but to actually make them part of the testing process using a language called Gerkin (and yeah, the whole show is full of pickle references). Matt also talks about SpecFlow, which is Cucumber for .NET and talks about all the different flavors of Cucumber out in the world. This naturally leads to a discussion about the state of Ruby since Cucumber started there. Great thoughts about how technologies evolve by branching and merging ideas!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Einar Høst, Jonas Winje and Bjørn Einar Bjartnes about their experiences using Reactive Extensions to control an AR Parrot Drone. The conversation starts out with a discussion on the fundamentals of reactive extensions, the idea of raising events around streams of data, and how that applies to something physical like a drone. Quickly, the core issue becomes time - we think about computing as instantaneous, and real life takes longer than that! A very geeky discussion about a cool way to program in real life.</description>

The conversation started out talking about the challenges that comparethemarket.com had with it's architecture a few years ago - an all too familiar problem of every new feature making the core applications less scalable, less stable and harder to maintain. James and Matt then dig into the process that comparethemarket.com went through to redesign the applications using micro services to simplify and strengthen the applications over time. Great architectural discussion!</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=914</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Troy Hunt about hacking yourself - testing your web site's defenses before someone else does! The conversation starts out talking about FireSheep and the need to use SSL everywhere. If you log in, you should be using SSL! Troy runs down a list of the common exploits you should test against, like SQL injection and cookie spoofing. There's also a discussion around cross-site scripting and X-Frame-Options. There are some simple things that script kiddies can do to exploit your site - you should do them first, and then defend yourself!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Kim Tripp about physical database design - and why it's still important. The conversation starts out talking about the state of SQL Server today, its maturity and how it works well enough that it's often ignored until there are problems. Kim talks about a 30-day blog series written by the SQLSkills team about being an accidental DBA - you didn't want to take care of a SQL Server, you just are! Always fun to talk to Kim!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard try something new - doing a mob style interview about mob programming! Mob programming takes agile to a new extreme where several people (more than two) work together to write code... resulting in very high quality code! The conversation digs into the actual process of writing code (drivers and navigators), the various roles that participants fall into, how more minds end up with more code reuse, testing, QA and the great sense of connection that comes with mob programming. You gotta try this! </description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard geek out on asteroid mining - the goal that could change mankind forever! After an initial conversation about the problems with sending humans to Mars (in a word: RADIATION), the topic turns to asteroid mining and those crazy folks at Planetary Resources. Richard attacks the idea of justifying asteroid mining with high value minerals and digs into the cooler idea - manufacturing in space. Once you solve the problems of prospecting, extraction and refining resources in space, you can start assembling into things! What do spacecraft and satellites look like if you don't care about lifting them from the Earth! Lots of fun thinking here!

Communicating with small computers takes cleverness too, so don't forget about serial and serial's grown-up cousin USB. From there, the conversation turns to different robots, especially quadcopters. Chris brings up his focus on getting kids more interested in computing - and embracing that they will always think about computing differently than we do!

					<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Guy Starbuck about his use of Azure Blob Storage as part of his continuous delivery solution. Guy starts out talking about how blob storage was built to handle huge files (like VHDs) but works just fine with small files - and is very cost effective! From there, Guy talks about how he's able to use Blob Storage to place Click-Once applications of his clients for testing purposes, making it easy to include his remote customers in the continuous delivery process. Great way to think about using the cloud for testing!</description>

					<description>It's show 900! While at That Conference, Carl and Richard recorded the 900th episode in front of an audience. The topic - geeking out on Automated Driving. The conversation starts with the history of automated driving, including the DARPA Grand Challenge initiatives. From there, the boys dig into how the Google car works, using LiDAR. Automated driving is inevitable (Sergey Brin says five years!), to the show ends with a discussion of how these cars will come into the market - you'll probably never buy one, just rent it when you need it!</description>

Automated driving is inevitable (Sergey Brin says five years!), to the show ends with a discussion of how these cars will come into the market - you'll probably never buy one, just rent it when you need it!</itunes:summary>

					<pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Bob Uva about instrumenting production software with New Relic. New Relic works with Ruby, Java, .NET and more, able to instrument applications end-to-end in production. And there's a free version you can use forever - how cool is that? Bob talks about how the instrumentation system works, reporting back to New Relic servers to give you great visualization of what is actually going on in your web application. Listen also for a great digression on engaging kids with programming also - another passion of Bob's. It's time to get instrumented!</description>

					<title>Big Data with Hadoop with Jeremiah Peschka</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=898</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jeremiah Peschka about implementing Hadoop in the .NET world. Jeremiah starts out the discussion pointing to a blog post he's done on the Basics of Hadoop (check the links) and how the focus of Hadoop is on the cloud - pre-configured Hadoop solutions in the cloud make life easier, but you have to get the data there. Jeremiah digs into the diversity of tools available to work with Hadoop - you can use SQL-like commands, or build your own controlling code in C#. And what about data mining?

Imagine all the good stuff of all your favorite languages in one place! John talks about how DART can compile into JavaScript for non-DART browsers, but runs natively at about ten times the speed of JavaScript. Although the only native browser is Dartium and is pre-beta, some day DART will show up in your regular browser!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the Norwegian Developers Conference (NDC) in Oslo last week, Carl and Richard moderated a panel talking about the state of functional programming in mainstream development. The discussion reached back in time to languages like Haskell and Erlang, and looked forward at JavaScript and it's vector to seemingly take over the world. Even if you're not well versed in functional languages, this was a great discussion.</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at NDC, Carl and Richard talk to Jez Humble about Continuous Delivery. Jez discusses the difference between continuous integration and continuous delivery and how nothing matters until your code actually gets to the customer. So no shipping parties until it does! The conversation digs into the overall story of DevOps, how development and operations need to work closer together to continuously deliver value to the customer - which is more about culture and process than it is about tools.</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at the Norwegian Developers Conference, Carl and Richard chatted with Jon Skeet about Async and Parallelism. The conversation starts out with a BKaF on parallel exception handling and a reader comment about F# and parallelism. Jon chimes in on both these subjects, talking about all the challenges around error handling, parallel or otherwise, and he knows (and doesn't know) about F#. Throughout the conversation there are short discussions on his effort to teach his sons programming as well. Great insights from Mr. Skeet!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk about space telescopes - but first, a comment about Thorium Molten Salt Reactors and a Kickstarter for a Thorium documentary called The Good Reactor. Also on Kickstarter is Arkyd, the space telescope that anyone can use - get a picture of yourself in space! The conversation then digs into space observatories, there are literally dozens up there today. Everyone knows about Hubble, but what about Compton, or Spitzer or Chandra? There are different observatories for different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Richard brings up Kepler, the little telescope that has detected hundreds of earth-sized planets around other stars. And don't forget about the upcoming replacement for Hubble, the James Webb Telescope! </description>

					<description>While at DevTeach, Carl and Richard talk to Kathleen Dollard about going beyond Async. And when she says beyond Async, she means the other amazing things in .NET 4.5. First up, the portable class libraries. Then Kathleen dives into Event Tracing for Windows classes that can let you do advanced logging in your applications. The conversation also dives into the dangers of the inline update that is .NET 4.5 from .NET 4.0... especially with the updates! Lots of subtle challenges with the latest incarnation of the .NET framework - and lots of possibilities!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Kevin Kline about the latest features in SQL Server 2012. The conversation starts out talking about the new features that developers will love, like windowing - no need for cursors anymore, you can request a window of records from a set and move easily window-to-window. Kevin also talks about the new column store index that is especially useful with repeating data. There's also a discussion on the role of SQL Server in an increasingly NoSQL world, along with cool new technologies like Hadoop, Cassandra and Hekaton. Kevin closes with an offer of some free tools at SQL Sentry, including Plan Explorer, a tool to help you understand the query plans that SQL Server makes from your queries. Check it out!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Marc Mercuri and Mark Simms about resilient cloud architecture.

While the topic area is huge, Marc and Mark break down the concepts into understanding your application, finding failure points, planning for failure (it's going to happen!) effective instrumentation and more. Lots of great thinking on how to build apps that can survive the huge tsunami of success.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard geek out on nanotechnology - and it's a huge subject! The conversation starts out with a proper definition of nanotechnology, as well as the original thinker in the space: Richard Feynman. Nanotechnology is far more than the original science fiction ideas of tiny robots and 'grey goo', it has expanded into super strong materials, particles that transport medicine and amazing two-dimensional crystals with remarkable properties, like graphene. We're only scratching the surface of nanotech with this show, write us a comment if you want to hear more!</description>

The conversation starts out with a proper definition of nanotechnology, as well as the original thinker in the space: Richard Feynman. Nanotechnology is far more than the original science fiction ideas of tiny robots and 'grey goo', it has expanded into super strong materials, particles that transport medicine and amazing two-dimensional crystals with remarkable properties, like graphene. We're only scratching the surface of nanotech with this show, write us a comment if you want to hear more!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Pablo Santos Does DVCS with PlasticSCM</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=869</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Pablo Santos about Plastic SCM. Plastic SCM is a free ALM tool for managing source and tracking for up to 15 developers - after that you have to pay. The conversation starts out with the concept of task-driven development, letting many developers work simultaneously on a project while each focusing on individual tasks. The challenge is excessive forking of the code - how do you get everything merged together again? Pablo talks about the powerful merge system of PlasticSCM to help identify identical code by functionality, not just syntax. Other strengths include great cross-platform support, integration with multiple IDEs, and support for lots of third party tools. Well worth checking out!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Mårten Rånge about Microsoft's Text Template Transformation Toolkit (T4). Don't call it code generation - Mårten talks about how T4 takes away code repetition and keeps you focused on the important stuff. The challenge is learning to build your own maintainable templates. The conversation explores a variety of examples of using T4 effectively for SQL, XAML as well as C# and C++. Mårten has a project on GitHub called T4Include to help you utilize them more effectively. The tooling isn't perfect, but there are alternatives - check it out!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Hendrik Lösch about his experiences doing testing with Visual Studio 2012. Henrik starts out talking about unit testing, the different approaches with various tools, including mocking, moles and fakes. He talks about how MSTest has substantially improved in Studio 2012, but still needs help in the form of NUnit and/or xUnit.net. The conversation also digs into new generation tools like NCrunch and SpecFlow, rationalizing BDD, TDD and ATDD and ultimately dealing with the social challenges of making testing and quality a core part of your development experience.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Donald Larson, a combination technology and nuclear scientist, about power from thorium. The conversation begins with thorium, a low-level radioactive metal that is three times more abundant than uranium and available all over the world, often found as a byproduct of other mining efforts. Don talks about the advantages of the thorium fuel cycle, how it cannot be used to make weapons-grade radioactives and doesn't require expensive pre-processing to be usable for power. From there the topic of molten salt reactors (MSR) is explored. MSRs can use radioactive materials besides thorium and have a number of safety advantages, not the least of which is being able to continuously refuel, have passive safety systems and an ability to utilize radioactive fuel more efficiently. The future of power is thorium!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Dominick Baier returns to talk to Carl and Richard about the current state of security in .NET 4.5. Dom starts out talking about how WebAPI has impacted the development of web services without much in the way of new security features - so he built some for everyone to use (check the links below). The conversation then digs into the challenges around OAuth 2 and the challenges of building specifications by committee when you're dealing with security. Also listen for a great dig into the real goals of identity technologies that largely haven't come to pass yet - there's still a ways to go!</description>

They're all related, even though they've come at the problem of understanding data from different directions. The conversation digs deeply into Hadoop, the Linux-centric MapReduce technology that has come to define the idea of Big Data, as well as Microsoft's implementation once called Project Isotope and now known as HDInsight. How big is Big Data? That's up to you!</itunes:summary>

					<title>Is Agile Dead at CodeMash</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=838</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>While at CodeMash in Sandusky Ohio, Carl and Richard moderated a panel discussion on the death of agile. The panel quickly agrees that agile isn't dead at all - it's become so mainstream that it is discussed less and less. A bigger discussion is what exactly agile is - a topic addressed by audience member Jon Kern, who was part of the group that developed the agile manifesto. </description>

					<title>Richard Astbury Migrates Applications to Azure</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=837</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Richard Astbury about migrating applications to Azure. The conversation starts out dealing with the basic idea of why you would migrate to the cloud - typically right before you have to buy more hardware to scale up or replace existing equipment. Richard then walks through the various challenges of migration, including migrating data, determining the particular style of cloud you want to use, maximizing advantages while minimizing cost. He talks about the fact that Java applications can be easier to migrate into Azure worker roles, since they tend to live in a sandbox and not touch the restricted elements of Windows inside the Azure world. Richard also digs into bootstrapping, providing links to tools to facilitate getting a worker role instance up and running with all the bits you need. Finally, the conversation digs into taking advantage of Azure - optimizing designs to reduce cost as well as utilizing the resources of Azure including Azure Fabric, Service Bus, diagnostics, etc.</description>

Yes, that's right, a framework based on violent karate moves, Rob talks about Roundhouse, a migration and source management tool for SQL, as well as DropKick, a deployment framework and UpperCut, a template build manager. There's more to Chuck Norris than just these bits, check it out in the show notes! Finally the conversation comes around the Chocolatey, aka apt-get for Windows.

					<pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Thiago Silva and Jeff Hewitt about building applications in Azure. The good? Scaling, deployment and costs. More good - great tools and information from Patterns and Practices. The bad? Getting coherent monitoring together. The conversation digs deep into Azure level monitoring, web level monitoring and application level monitoring. How do you relate the data together? What measurements matter? How do you get to the point where you have a dashboard that shows you the health of your application? Finally, there is the ugly - and it's called licensing. Thiago and Jeff talk about how some license models (like per-machine licensing) just don't work in Azure. Good stuff for getting serious about Azure!</description>

					<description>The first geek out of 2013, Carl and Richard talk about nuclear power. Much feared and maligned, Richard walks through the principles of atomic theory, how neutrons are the key to the whole process and why Uranium-235 is so much more important than Uranium-238. The conversation also dives into some alternative nuclear power concepts including Traveling Wave Reactors, Pebble Bed Reactors and Thorium Salt Reactors. But they steer clear of fusion - that's another show!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>On the .NET Rocks! Visual Studio 2012 Launch Road Trip, Carl and Richard stopped in at the NoVa Code Camp in Reston, Virginia and talked to Oren Eini about the role of NoSQL in modern application development. Oren explores the compromises that developers make to work with relational databases - compromises that are made by reflex, with almost no thought. He makes the case that in many cases, building applications that store data in NoSQL stores (including RavenDB) are simpler, more reliable and faster to develop. So what is the role of SQL Server in this new world? Listen to find out!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Dr. Yngve Falck-Ytter about his efforts to understand programming. Yngve talks about the limitations of the software in the medical industry and how he's learned to work around it with some of his own programming. Ultimately the conversation digs into the idea that good software can make treatments more effective and less expensive and, in the end, save more lives.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Alex Robson about polyglot programming. Alex talks about various languages including Erlang. He focuses on the idea that different languages have different strength, and trying to function in a monoculture of only one programming language limits your ability to solve problems efficiently. The conversation goes on to talk about the different patterns of development available once you stop thinking about the limits of your language!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Jon Rozenblit about the latest set of features in Azure. The conversation starts with a discussion about Azure Mobile Services, which is really a REST storage system that doesn't need to involve mobile at all - maybe they'll fix the name! Next, with Richard's encouragement, Carl talks about his need for virtual machines and Jon digs into the features of the new virtual machine features in Azure. Jon also tackles the challenge of pricing, running on premise and how the new features in Azure make things easier for moving from on-premise to cloud and back again. Great conversation if you're ready to take a fresh look at Azure!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Phil Trelford about the new features in F# 3.0, the version shipping with Visual Studio 2012. Phil talks about how F# is functional first, object second, as opposed to C# which is object first, functional second - but the two languages work together fine. He also digs into using F# with XAML to do UI related work. The conversation turns to projects using F# including it's role in Halo 3! F# is at its magic third version! Check out the ton of links to this show, all sorts of great stuff for getting started with F#.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Chris Patterson about MassTransit, an open source enterprise service bus. The conversation starts out talking about service bus in general, how the patterns around a service bus make it easier to build large, multiversion applications with the fewest dependencies possible. Chris sets MassTransit in context with large, expensive service buses like Biztalk. He also digs into some of the other projects he's worked on, including TopShelf (for building Windows services) and Magnum (the mother of all toolkits). The boys also ask Chris about his focus on open source, the advantages and disadvantages around licensing, pricing and support. Amazing smart guy with some awesome code!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Microsoft tech fellow Brian Harry about Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2012 and Team Foundation Server. Brian digs into the thinking around the latest version of Microsoft's ALM offering, including the new tools for gathering requirements using storyboards, video, audio and annotations around applications. The conversation also digs into the core 'lather-rinse-repeat' cycle of developers getting work assignments, building and checking in their code. Then onto the amazing new features in testing and providing early look versions of applications for gathering feedback. Finally Brian talks about Team Foundation Services, TFS-in-the-Cloud so to speak, which while not directly tied to Studio 2012, does point to Microsoft's future focus for ALM. A great conversation with a guy at the center of everything ALM at Microsoft!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Microsoft VP Jason Zander about the release of Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5. Jason addresses many of the key points around building Studio 2012 - the deep integration with Windows 8, how the teams worked together to allow the C++/XAML, C#/XAML and HTML5/WinJS development approaches... even why the Studio 2012 UI looks the way it does! The conversation then jumps to developing for ARM, some time talking about cloud development, even a mention of Sharepoint and Office tools. Great insight from a guy who has been part of .NET since the beginning!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard chat with Julie Lerman about Entity Framework 5. EF5 ships with .NET 4.5 - yep, they broke the number synchronization this time around. Julie explains that the big number change is for a good reason - this is a big update to Entity Framework. The conversation digs into the new features, including performance improvements, enumerations and spatial datatype support. Julie also talks about a huge number of little things that are added to make EF a much more useable project. Has the magic version three happened again at Microsoft?</description>

Julie also talks about a huge number of little things that are added to make EF a much more useable project. Has the magic version three happened again at Microsoft?</itunes:summary>

					<pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Darth Vader, a.k.a. Jon McCoy who shows developers how to hack .NET apps in memory and on disk. This turns into a pretty dark discussion about how challenging it is to secure in depth - infiltration and exfiltration vectors, how protection tools (like anti-virus) are great mechanisms for spreading malware. And according to Jon, .NET is a great tool for hiding malicious code. He talks about how he can modify a .NET application while it is running and use it to manipulate and steal information. Not a happy show!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Bob Martin about where object orientation is going. Bob starts out talking about the fundamentals of where object orientation came from and how it has progressed over the years. The conversation then digs into how hardware has changed - the CPU manufacturers have stopped making faster processors and switched to making more processors. The impact of this change means developers have to write parallel executing code, something that object orientation makes difficult. Bob talks about the resurgence of functional programming as a reaction to the need for parallelism. Has object orientation run its course?</description>

					<description>While at NDC is Oslo, Norway, Carl and Richard talk to Hadi Hariri about MVC. Hadi talks about his experiences building MVC applications, starting with where WebForms taught some bad habits in web application construction, how some of the new Javascript libraries (like jQuery) made MVC more palatable and the performance advantages of well designed MVC. The conversation also digs into some of the mistakes novice MVC developers make, like putting far too much (and repeating) code in the controller. There's also a discussion about different data storage options as well as Hadi's position on utilizing REST.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to J Sawyer about StreamInsight. Part of the SQL Server platform, StreamInsight is a stand-alone install that allows you to do complex event processing (CEP) applications. Complex Event Processing is a pattern of dealing highly parallel, high velocity data streams to do real-time analysis. J talks about how StreamInsight simplifies CEP handling all the parallelism and memory management for you. The conversation also digs into the relationship between Reactive Extensions and StreamInsight - they compliment each other. This is about taking logging to a whole new level!</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Toub about how the beta of Studio 11 has impacted parallelism. The conversation starts with a solid discussion about the difference between asynchronous, concurrency and parallelism. From there, Stephen talks about how Studio 11 has matured async and await, largely under the hood, to take advantage of more hardware and better concurrency with no additional code. He mentions the ASync Targeting Pack bringing async and await to Silverlight 5. Finally Stephen talks about some of the new instrumentation in Studio 11 to understand how parallelism is working in your application to assist with debugging and performance. Parallelism is moving forward in Studio 11!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Stephen Bohlen about architecture. The conversation starts with Stephen's work on spring.net and the relationship between Java and .NET. Then Stephen digs into the evolution of architecture, comparing his experience as a 'real' architect designing buildings to building software. He discusses how using the term software engineer is part of what led to the waterfall approach of software development and how agile is fighting back against the term and behavior. </description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=773</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard start out talking to Scott Hunter about what's coming up in ASP.NET - but then he goes beyond! The conversation starts out talking about where the .NET Framework as a whole is going - Scott reveals some of the internal discussions they're having about how to evolve the .NET Framework. Scott also talks about Single Page Applications (SPA), which are part of the beta of ASP.NET 4.5 but will not be making the shipping version. SPA will be back in an update to ASP.NET after the Studio 11 ship date. The conversation then goes into some of the features coming in ASP.NET 4.5, including performance features for JavaScript and CSS, as well as implementing OpenAuth.</description>

					<title>Dominick Baier Updates Us on Identity in .NET 4.5</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=772</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard catch up with Dominick Baier to talk about the changes to identity in the 4.5 Framework, Windows 8 and Server 2012. Dominick lets us know that claims-based security is everywhere in 4.5 - built right into the System libraries. No more separate WIF to install! The conversation also digs into the fact that Windows 8 and Server 2012 are rolling claims-based security into Active Directory, making implementation even simpler. Role-based security continues to function, but everything under the hood is a claim.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard are back in space! With the SpaceX launch to the International Space Station, the boys decide they have to talk about space again. A big chunk of the conversation focuses on how a billionaire boys club has grown up around space - folks like Elon Musk who made their money in technology are now spending it to expand mankind's reach into space, and perhaps make a buck or two along the way. Beyond SpaceX there is Planetary Resources, a gathering of a bunch of internet billionaries to mine asteroids. Is this how mankind will expand into space?</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Brian Noyes about the Single Page Application (SPA) feature coming in MVC 4. Brian talks about the similarities of the design patterns for SPA to the more classical Silverlight or WPF application with RIA or WCF services on the back end. While hardly new to the web space (SPAs can be traced back to Outlook Web Access circa 2002), SPAs are going to be part of Studio 11. Brian talks through the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard continue the Geek Out series on alternative energy with wind power. The conversation starts with the admission that as much as has been done with wind power so far, it's just a tiny drop in the bucket of total power consumption - less than 1% of US power comes from wind. Then the boys dig into the different types of wind power generation, the challenges that the power grid has incorporating wind power into the grid, and the kinds of problems that home owners have with wind power also. Wind has potential, but also problems. But long term it's part of the solution.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Bart de Smet about the beta of Reactive Extensions (Rx) Version 2. Currently in beta when the show was recorded, Rx 2.0 works with .NET 4.5, both for desktop and metro, as well as Silverlight 5 and Windows Phone 7.1. Bart talks about how Rx lets you write LINQ expressions over top of events, completely changing the way you think about responding to events. If you're tired of cluttering up your UI code with event handlers or you've got a back end process that needs to deal with millions of incoming events, you owe it to yourself to look at Rx!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Bill Wilder about Hadoop on Azure. Hadoop is a technology for analyzing massive (petabytes) amount of data efficiently. Originally developed by Yahoo, it was given to the Apache Foundation as an open source project. Google, Facebook and others have all contributed to the project. Microsoft has come late to the game, but with a very compelling offering - you can run Hadoop on Azure and use Visual Studio to work with it. There's lots to learn about Hadoop, this show is just the starting point!</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2012 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>The first of many alternative energy geek outs, Carl and Richard talk about solar power. The boys talk about using solar in the home in the form of thermal as well as photovoltaic, at utility scale with solar thermal, even space-based power. The conversation explores the huge diversity of photovoltaics, including concentrators and quantum dot technologies, the advantages and disadvantages involved. There's also a brief discussion on battery technologies, since solar power doesn't work all that well at night. In the end there aren't easy answers, but things are advancing forward - the amount of solar power being generated these days is increasing!</description>

Then the focus goes to the MVC vs. WebForms debate, which isn't a debate at all in Scott's eyes. And then things take a turn for the worse (or is that silly) and Scott starts answering questions on twitter about his hair. Lots of laughs, but not a lot of technical content ensues thereafter.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>The last of the vignette shows from Oredev, this one only has two parts, but they're oddly related. The first interview is with Aaron Parecki, who talks about taking a side project that was worked on only evenings and weekends into an actual funded startup. Then an amazing conversation with Amber Case, an actual cyborg anthropologist. It's not as weird as you think, as Amber points out, any time you extend your physical or mental abilities with a peice of technology - say, a cell phone, you're a cyborg. </description>

					<itunes:summary>The last of the vignette shows from Oredev, this one only has two parts, but they're oddly related. The first interview is with Aaron Parecki, who talks about taking a side project that was worked on only evenings and weekends into an actual funded startup. Then an amazing conversation with Amber Case, an actual cyborg anthropologist. It's not as weird as you think, as Amber points out, any time you extend your physical or mental abilities with a peice of technology - say, a cell phone, you're a cyborg. </itunes:summary>

					<pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Kathy Malone about green computing. Kathy, who has a day job as an environmental engineer, talks about different types of green behaviour, including turning off PCs over night, using suspend mode and the like. But for developers, there are approaches to building software that consumes fewer resources, both electrical and human energy. Is there an additional price in resources to be paid for touch computing?</description>

					<title>Communicating at Oredev</title>
					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=724</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Another of the vignette shows from Oredev, Carl and Richard explore topics of communication. Up first is Udi Dahan, discussing his approach to domain driven design, focusing on communicating deeply with the stakeholders and domain experts to thoroughly explore the domain - even around something on the surface that seem simple like the concept of a customer. Next, Jim Benson digs into Kanban, including the idea of personal Kanban, which like the development and manufacturing methodology, focuses on being able to clearly see how much work is in progress and where things are being delayed from completion. Finally, the one-and-only Jon Skeet, talking about how his technical communication skills have evolved from answering thousands of questions on newsgroups and Stack Overflow. </description>

					<title>Damian Edwards and David Fowler Persist Connections with SignalR</title>

					<pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Damian Edwards and David Fowler about SignalR. SignalR is a library for providing persistant connections between a web server and a browser by providing an abstraction over top of technologies like WebSockets or even AJAX polling. SignalR requires .NET 4.0 on the back end and jQuery on the front end... although non-browser clients are in the future!</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=722</link>
					<pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Another set of stories from Oredev, this time around development practices. The first interview is with Dan North, where he discusses how development teams can move beyond just being able to ship software into something he calls hyper-productivity. He talks about teams that ship software twenty times a day! Next up, Jean Tabaka talks about how RallyDev uses Agile practices to make the entire company Agile. At RallyDev every person is involved in planning out the vision of the company quarter to quarter, from developer to executive. Finally, Gary Short digs into the challenges of technical debt - the idea that shortcuts in code increase the cost of development in the long term. Sometimes debt make sense, getting more features shipped in less time. But eventually the debt has to be repaid or the project goes bankrupt, unable to ship new features and ultimately cancelled.</description>

					<pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Next up from Oredev - the cool projects! Carl and Richard talk to the one-and-only Tess Ferrandez from Microsoft. Tess has moved on from the mad debugging skills she blogged about to focus on Kinect and Windows Phone 7. The conversation digs into using Kinect beyond XBox games. Next up, Luca Minudel discusses his experiences building software for Formula One racing, perhaps the ultimate gadget ever! Finally, the show closes with Henrik Andersson of Tobii talking about prototype eye tracking hardware built into a laptop. Tobii also makes a .NET SDK so that you can easily add eye tracking to a XAML application. These are just some of the cool projects that were talked about at Oredev!</description>

					<link>http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=717</link>
					<pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>The next collection of tales from Oredev focuses on data visualization. The first conversation is with Alastair Allan, talking about his experiences in visualizing the GPS tracking data stored by every iPhone 4. While it was generally known that the iPhone kept a record of every GPS location and WiFi connection, it was not until Alasdair's visualization application let anyone (especially reporters) see on a map exactly what was in their own phone that the story became a sensation. Next, a conversation with Jon Dahl about minimalist programming and it's impact on the readability of code - a different, yet still important type of visualization. Finally the show ends with a conversation with Nora Herting and Heather Willems of ImageThink. ImageThink was at Oredev to create, in real time, graphic visualizations of the keynotes and conference sessions. While not technical specialists themselves, Nora and Heather talk about how really listening to lectures and conversations about technology provides cues for what is important in the visualizations. Visualizations have power!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Dan Hanan and Danny Warren about mixing Kinect together with WinRT. Back at the Build conference keynote a 'marketecture' diagram showed how existing applications still work in Windows 8 but also introduced a new platform using WinRT. At the time attendees were told that the blue side (existing applications) and the green side (WinRT) will never cross. Then the folks at Interknowlogy got to work. Dan and Danny talk about how they built an application utilizing Kinect, depending on an SDK that runs on the blue side to communicate with a Metro application that runs on the green side. Crossing the streams? You bet!</description>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Scott Allen about Modernizr, an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites by reporting browser features. Scott talks about how Modernizr focuses on actually testing for the availability of features on a browser, rather than just relying on the browser useragent and a browser capabilities file. Along the way there is plenty of IE6 bashing.

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Tomasz Janczuk about node.js. Node.js is all about building scalable network programs, typically using HTTP. Tomasz talks about how node.js can run as a standalone application that can completely replace a web server, as well as run within IIS as iisnode. iisnode is an implemenation of node.js as a native IIS module. Node.js has been around since 2009, and the community surrounding it is massive - it's only new to the .NET world. Ready to do something totally different on the web from ASP.NET? </description>

					<itunes:summary>Carl and Richard talk to Tomasz Janczuk about node.js. Node.js is all about building scalable network programs, typically using HTTP. Tomasz talks about how node.js can run as a standalone application that can completely replace a web server, as well as run within IIS as iisnode. iisnode is an implemenation of node.js as a native IIS module. Node.js has been around since 2009, and the community surrounding it is massive - it's only new to the .NET world. Ready to do something totally different on the web from ASP.NET? </itunes:summary>

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Philip Laureano about Nemerle. Nemerle is a multi-paradigm programming language for .NET. Similar to C#, it goes beyond C# to provide metaprogramming features, allowing you to write code that changes code on the fly. Phil digs deep into the idea that programming languages should change to reflect what we want to do and is not afraid to do the changes himself, rather than wait for Microsoft. Brain twisting?

					<description>Carl and Richard talk to Kate Gregory about the history of C, culminating in the latest version, C++0x (aka C++ 11). Kate points out that C++ is more popular than ever, no matter what the managed memory folks are saying. The conversation works through the various flavors of C, how the language has continued to evolve, even to the point of doing memory management! Along the way Kate digs into the new features of C++0x, many of which (like lambdas) seem awfully familiar... the conversation ends on a great discussion on massive parallelism. Could C++ solve the parallel problem?</description>

					<description>While at the Norwegian Developers Conference in Oslo, Norway, Carl and Richard talk to Ingo Rammer about building 'native' HTML 5 apps. Ingo talks about PhoneGap, a wrapper over HTML for building applications that run on all mobile platforms. But then he goes further, talking about other variations on the idea of using HTML 5 as the presentation markup while still being able to connect to the native resources of the platform. Could this be the programming platform of the future?</description>

After a quick tour down memory lane about MEF and Brad Abrams, Glenn discusses WCF Web APIs. The Web APIs focus WCF onto pure HTTP, making it easier to build RESTful applications while not requiring your applications to use REST. WCF Web APIs are all about creating HTTP clients and servers that do not have to be browsers and web servers, opening HTTP to a whole new world of devices and simplifying testing of your HTTP applications.</description>

					<description>Emre Kiciman and Mark Friedman talk about bringing AjaxView to Visual Studio. Emre previously talked about AjaxView on .NET Rocks when it was a Microsoft Research project to enable developers to profile the behavior of JavaScript on the browser. Since then, AjaxView has been developed as the Microsoft Visual Studio AJAX Profiling Extensions. Mark as part of the Studio team focused on making AjaxView work in Studio. The conversation not only digs into what AjaxView can do for a developer, but the challenges of bringing a research project to the mainstream.

					<pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2005 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Only a week after returning from a 30-day trip through the interior of the American heartland, we found ourselves in Merry Old England speaking at and attending the VBUG Winter Conference. Carl moderated a Code-Off in which four developers each created a user interface for a system of web services, each using a different technology. They then showed off those applications in a very small window of time. Immediately following this, we interviewed them in front of the audience. We also spoke one-on-one to Graham Parker, one of the code-off developers, about VBUG and the UK .NET community.

Note: The sound is a bit off during this show because we didn't have control over the audio. :-)</description>

					<pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2005 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>New York Regional Director Stephen Forte talks with Carl and Rory about many cool things, including SQL Server 2005 (Yukon). He's got some good advice for how to get the most out of it. As well, the conversation turned to clustering and RAID strategies. This was a great talk with one of the Northeast's sharpest .NET minds, not to mention mountain climbers and extreme... well, let's just say he's extreme and leave it at that. </description>

					<description>As the original co-host of .NET Rocks!, mark didn't say all that much. Well, look out! He's talking about his current passions, ADO.NET 2.0 and BizTalk 2004, and we can't shut him up! This is a great conversation with a true ADO.NET expert. Mark has a knack for explaining complex ideas in a very natural and easy manner.  If you still don't get BizTalk, this is the show to listen to. Mark explains why BizTalk is great from a very practical perspective, and explains why he is on a crusade to get developers as excited about BizTalk as IT managers are.</description>

Juval talks about serialization now and in 2.0, the new System.Transaction namespace and how cool it really is, putting System.EnterpriseServices in perspective, some quick lip service to generics (although he discussed that in show #34), and a little criticism of the new Visual Studio 2005. Thom Robbins joins us in the second half to talk about his recent CodeCamp event, and the New England district. Richard is still climbing mountains, but Rory is on fire with Google Weirdos and Ask Rory. Kirk has some good websites as well. Warning: this show is rated at least PG-13.</description>

					<pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2004 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>We try to have representatives from Microsoft on the show every once in a while to talk about what's happening in Redmond. This week we had four program managers for the Evangelism team: Scott Burmester, Steve Cellini, Carter Maslan, and Jeff Sandquist. The topic? Whidbey! We get a check up on the progress of the next version of .NET. We talked at length about the up-and-coming Visual Studio 2005 Team System, and the efforts to reach application developers who don't necessarily spend time in the development community. We also ask each of them to tell us something about Whidbey that we probably don't already know. All in all it's a good show, even if Rory and Richard are on vacation.</description>

					<pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2004 00:00:00 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>In this, our first show after a much-needed vacation, we take you to TechEd 2004 in San Diego. We walked around on the show floor and talked to some of our former and future guests about TechEd, what's new, and what they're interested in.We recorded most of this show on video, and as such will be airing ".NET Rocks! The Movie" as soon as we possibly can. Until then, enjoy some of the more interesting sonic tidbits of the film.In the first half we spoke to Tim Huckaby, Keith Nicholson, Billy Hollis, Don Kiely, Stephen Forte, Don Box, and Jon Lam.In the second half, we spent about 40 minutes in an INETA Birds Of a Feather (BOF) Session that we recorded Sunday night, in which Bob Reselman showed up and got things juiced up. There is also a lot of obvious interest in the Visual Studio Team System, which was announced at TechEd. We spoke with Paul Sheriff, Brian Noyes, and Chris Kinsman about their impressions of the Team System, and then we caught up with some Microsft team members to talk about it.</description>

					<pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>This week Carl and Mark throw down a few pints at the historic Dutch Tavern in downtown New London, CT and you're invited! Listen to stories from their recent week of teaching a VB.NET class to 27 people, challenging code puzzles, interesting characters, and of course, beer.

This is a very relaxed show, but don't think you won't learn a thing or two. C'mon! Just have one more Black and Tan! 
Note: The show starts out a bit noisy, then gets better. There were some rowdy people in there when we first started recording, and they left shortly afterwords.

					<pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>This is a rare opportunity to have a conversation with people at Microsoft who are so closely tied to VB and VB.NET. They talked about new features in Whidbey, the next version of Visual Basic expected out in 2004 sometime, including some features that nobody knows about outside of the Alpha program! You'll have to listen to find out what they are!

Carl and Mark talked about the things they like and have disliked about VB in the past, and how VB.NET has really brought the language to the forefront of the serious development community. As well, they ask some interesting questions like, "what parts of the .NET Framework were written in VB.NET" and other goodies. There are plenty of laughs as well. If you're a VB programmer, you've got to hear this!

					<pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Mark and Carl talk with Brent about intellectual property, namely assembly and application obfuscation: techniques used, and the resultant binaries. They also talk about Remoting and get Brent's take on the value of Remoting. 

But the big gem in this show, we think, is Brent's 5-minute description of how Code Access Security works, which we immediately recognize as something very special.

					<pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>This week, Carl and Mark talk to Juval Lowy about, among other things, the new version of C# (2.0). Of the new features, Juval's favorite is Generics.

					<pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>This week Carl and Mark got to do a show they've been waiting for a long time to do. The conversation touches on the new application blocks (bluebricks - from the MS Patterns and Practices Group), string handling, using the BitConverter class for fast file i/o, serialization, XMLDataDocuments and XSLT, inheritance, instrumentation, the ASP.NET Cache object, and some great stories from the trenches, especially Mark's great training stories which always contain an array of shady characters and companies. All in all, its an hour well spent for .NET developers

					<pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>Carl engaged Matthew in a lively discussion about his incredible website (.NET 24/7) which provides instant gratification for help on any of the classes in the .NET framework in the form of links to published articles, newsgroup discussions, and blog entries. Matthew is a big fan of weblogs, which he discusses in the interview. 

They also talked about the C# vs. VB.NET issue, and other issues associated with particular languages. As well, the conversation touched on the next versions of the framework and VS.NET. 

Matthew is happy to receive comments or feedback on any topic via his webblog at weblogs.asp.net. 

Please don't send us email about the poor quality of the audio. The source recording was not good, and we have made it as good as it can be.

					<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2003 16:43:07 EDT</pubDate>
					<description>This show is a lively and candid conversation with three members of the Microsoft .NET Evangelism team.  In this episode Mark takes a break to enjoy his sons last baseball game of the season. Carl talks to the team about what they do and how their efforts impact the quality of the framework and developer tools in general. 
Get a behind-the-scenes look at the daily operations of the .NET Evangelism team and how it operates. Other topics include companies that Microsoft has worked with as early adopters, Visual Basic.NET vs C#, why Regional Directors are so special (grin), why web services are the new focus of the .NET moniker and why it gives developers severe acid reflux, why developers are still stuck on nanosecond-level performance differences, differences between DevDays; Tech-Ed; and the Professional Developers Conference (PDC). Fascinating stuff. Also, Carl plays a wicked cool guitar piece in lieu of the first ad spot!</description>

					<description>Mark Dunn is on temporary leave in Redmond, WA this week teaching a beta Architecture class. Scott and Carl chat about .NET, C#, Reflection, Regular Expressions, Freeware, Code Sharing, Config Files, Sockets, Multi-Threaded programming, and a laundry list of Scott's favorite utilities (shown below) that you just have to check out. 

We had a few comments that the shows were not loud enough. So, starting with this show the volume has been maximized.

					<description>Alan has a lot to say about programming, programmers, and focuses intently on what's wrong with programming as we know it. Why do businesspeople fear programmers? Is the construction of software managed? These topics and more are the focus of this monumental episode of .NET Rocks! 

Alan tells the story of that meeting where he showed Visaul Basic (then code-named Ruby) to Bill Gates and his people.

					<description>Chris talks with Test with Carl and Mark about COM and .NET components, finalizers, disposing, Smart Client Windows Forms Applications (we still don't know what to call these things), how to navigate sellsbrothers.com, interview weed-out questions, and why he calls it Sells Brothers. Also, Chris finally clears up the age-old question of why C++ programmers feel so superior to mere humans. 

Chris' main web page is www.sellsbrothers.com. There you can subscribe to his many lists and take advantage of all the great free information and code he shares with the community. Chris writes regularly for MSDN Magazine on advanced topics. 

Trust us, you will save yourself hours of guesswork by taking an hour and a half of your day to listen to this interview. This show was actually recorded in mid-November, and its still fresh! </description>
